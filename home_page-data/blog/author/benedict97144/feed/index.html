										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is the second-largest money transfer fintech company globally after Western Union. It offers a long and well-established record of services. Most people and experts would solidly recommend using MoneyGram any time and any day because of its comprehensive services.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company offers cheap rates for certain currencies and a well and long-established record of service and extensive coverage.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What are its fees and Exchange rates?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here&#8217;s the dropdown;</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exchange Rate Margins:</span></em></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is known to apply the standard practice of taking a margin on the exchange rate. This means that the exchange rate offered to MoneyGram customers isn&#8217;t as good as the actual mid-market exchange rate. And MoneyGram profits from such a difference. Which is known as the exchange rate margin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram&#8217;s fees and exchange rates leave the service as the cheapest provider between countries. And according to analysis, MoneyGram was said to be the cheapest provider. That is, it took 1% of online searches across over half a million searches about sending and receiving money in Africa in September 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let&#8217;s use an example to make this discussion a bit simple for you. If you were in Los Angeles in the United States, and you desired to send about 1000 dollars to Beijing in China. You would have to pay about 58 dollars in total fees. And your beneficiary would receive about $942 if you decided to send via WorldRemit.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now, suppose you decided to still make the same transfer with MoneyGram, on the other hand. In that case, you&#8217;d pay a considerably high total fee of 78 dollars. And your beneficiary would be receiving $922. That&#8217;s more than a thousand yuan fewer than they&#8217;d receive if you&#8217;d sent with WorldRemit.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base Fees:</span></em></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MoneyGram fees vary, and that depends on the amount sent. Also, it depends on the transfer and receiving countries, and the payment and receiving methods. Here&#8217;s how you can save on fees with MoneyGram;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sending to a bank account is usually less expensive than sending money for cash pick-up.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;re sending money for cash-pickup, the online service will generally be cheaper than sending money at an agent location, and only if you make payments by bank transfer.</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When transferring in any kind online with MoneyGram, it would be best to pay by bank transfer if this would be available.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;re sending money to a bank account, it&#8217;s often more affordable to send at an agent location than online, and that&#8217;s regardless of the payment technique used. Still, the agent location fees can also vary a bit, and that&#8217;s depending on which location you do select.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is it easy to transfer money through MoneyGram?</span></h2>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The web design is also said to be uncluttered and straightforward, and that&#8217;s for example, it&#8217;s known to include a concise and relatively transparent breakdown of the fees you can expect to pay.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With all that said, MoneyGram&#8217;s website includes precise, valuable, and easy-to-access alternatives for those who wish to track their money and monitor, especially when received by the recipient, that&#8217;s providing a safe and accessible option, and only if you would like to keep an eye on your transfer.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Registering on MoneyGram; what it entails.</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most online service is said to be plain and simple, clear and easy instructions and even explanations. Nevertheless, we do have to put here that you&#8217;ll need to fill out various fields to sign up successfully and agree with terms and conditions you don&#8217;t have time to read.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Things that they will need from you are your home/billing address, birth date, mobile number.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There&#8217;s much credibility:</span></em></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is a giant multinational company that&#8217;s also publicly traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market with a whopping sum of over 200 million dollars of market capitalization in September 2020 alone.</span></li>

During this time, it&#8217;s been known to have gone through several collaborations and acquisitions and has demonstrated significant expertise in the Money transfer industry.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can&#8217;t proceed with this without explaining what Bitsika means. <strong>Bitsika</strong> is simply a remittance platform that utilizes cryptocurrencies and fiat money to send or deliver quick money transfers. It sends or delivers in Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, and more African countries within a specific transaction threshold.</p>
<p>Bitsika was launched in 2019. So far, the company has managed to process one million dollars&#8217; transaction on its platform in less than three months.</p>
<h2>How to make instant money transfer using Bitsika;</h2>
<p>First of all, you have to know the supported money payments for this platform. They are; credit or debit cards, mobile money, Bitcoin, and bank transfer.</p>
<p>Also, you can send money to just anyone who has the Bitsika app in supported countries by simply using their username. And the process is somewhat instant, and you can send as little as one cent. And the recipient receives the money in less than about five minutes.</p>
<h2>The signing-up process;</h2>
<p>First of all, you need to use your Gmail account to sign up for the Bitsika app. And Google takes such responsibility to manage your password and ensure your overall safety.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you&#8217;ll also need to download the app onto your phone, tablet, or any mobile internet-enabled gadget in particular. With that done, you&#8217;ll be assigned a username. It starts with the dollar encoded sign— $Martin, $Catherine, $Kate, etc. The Bitsika app is available on the Apple Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>When you have your username, you&#8217;ll automatically have your account set up for you. There will be no further hassling procedures.</p>
<h2>Acting it</h2>
<p>$Martin in Nairobi desires to send money to $Kate in Cape Town. He makes a deposit of 200 dollars&#8217; credits on the Bitsika app through bank transfer or credit card. Then he proceeds by sending that 200 dollars to $Kate, all within the app. $Kate withdraws the money through mobile money. And the transaction is processed within three minutes in the maximum.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk about how you make a deposit using Bitsika;</h2>
<p>You can deposit cash on the application through various payment platforms such as debit cards or bank transfers. Each deposited amount is virtually exchanged into USDC currency, issued by Coinbase. It is preserved in the app as your balance. And, the good part about this is, the deposited amount never changes its value.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ll like to ask you this, do you know what USDC is?</h2>
<p>USDC is simply a stable coin backed by the United States currency or, simply put, US dollars. They are known to be held in reserve by regulated financial institutions. Regulated financial institutions also issue the tokens themselves. Also, every token can be redeemed for just 1$, and that&#8217;s providing a price-stable cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>How does $Kate make her withdrawal?</h2>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s simple. With Bitsika, you can decide to withdraw from the app to your bank account or another digital wallet such as mobile money.</p>
<p>And do you know that transferring money between countries happens with the help of crypto in the background? But you aren&#8217;t even aware of this, I guess? As they are fondly called, these USD credits are believed to be the best way the African market trader will access the USD without any form of hustle and toil. It&#8217;s also believed to be a great store of value for you. Yes, talking to you! and that&#8217;s if you want to hedge your assets from unstable currencies. Quite cheeky.</p>
<h2>This is what you’ll be expecting by making transactions with the Bitsika app;</h2>
<p>For just any transaction on Bitsika of up to three hundred dollars, there are no charges included! Neither does the service add a markup on the exchange rate. There&#8217;ll also be a small charge— just that small, and that&#8217;s after you cross the needed threshold.</p>
<p>In general, Bitsika is known to make its money from interest on fiat and crypto reserves. From such percentages, it charges on merchant API for businesses that desire to collect money from its users. It can be users from all over Africa and other parts of the world through Bitsika credits.</p>
<h2>Here are countries you can send or receive cash via Bitsika;</h2>
<p>As I said, at the moment, Bitsika permits its customers to send money to their friends and family in the following countries;</p>
<p>Mauritius, Gabon, Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana.</p>
<p>Here are the supported payment gateways;</p>
<p>Presently, the supported payment methods are Bank transfer (if you&#8217;re Nigerian), Mobile Money (Ghanaian), Bitcoin (worldwide), and Credit and Debit cards (worldwide).</p>
<p>Reasons on why you should use Bitsika apps to make transfers<strong>; </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Bitsika is known to be a multi-currency app. </em></li>
<li><em>You can also generate a virtual VISA card right on this app. Use it to pay on your favorite websites. For example, Netflix, Amazon, and everywhere virtual VISA card is accepted. </em></li>
<li><em>It does a KYC on you for security reasons; this means your transaction details are all safe. </em></li>
<li><em>You can also purchase airtime in Nigeria or Ghana— and that’s if you’re looking for the means to make a quick recharge. </em></li>
<li><em>Bitsika app is known to allow you to make money off the platform, and that&#8217;s by simply introducing and referring your friends. And you earn a 1-dollar referral for doing so. </em></li>
</ol>
<h2>What you can do with Bitsika;</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>It serves as a wallet. </em></li>
<li><em>As a form of social payment.</em></li>
<li><em>You can use it to create virtual cards. </em></li>
<li><em>Buy and sell BUSD. </em></li>
<li><em>Buy and sell bitcoin, etc. </em></li>
</ol>
<h2>Final Say</h2>
<p>Bitsika has entered and is seemingly penetrating Africa to reduce all costs of sending money, which is known to be the highest globally.</p>
<p>This fintech plans on becoming the leading money transfer in the continent, and that’s by simply using blockchain technology to save money and time in international money transfers.</p>
<p>In addition, it has also identified and solved the two major issues relating to Pan-African international transfers: rigorous and difficult modes of sending and receiving cash and pricing. The app also has the much-needed poise to spread to the rest of the continent in a short while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing is the ultimate link that connects customers to your product. However, the supreme driver of these links to your product is the product marketing manager (PMM), the individual that knows your actual customers.</p>
<p>In truth, as a product marketing manager, you’re on the verge of growing your company by connecting customers to your product.  But then, it is not as easy as it sounds. Nevertheless, we have summed a comprehensive guide to help you properly implement a working strategy that works for your product marketing.</p>
<p>But one quick question pops to mind.</p>
<h3>How are product management and product marketing related?</h3>
<p>Well, you probably might have seen the term “product management” often used on business blogs and mostly used to refer to marketing. Now you’re at a crossroad to know whether they mean the same thing or not.?</p>
<p>Actually, you’re not alone. A lot of people, even business enthusiasts often confuse product marketing with product management.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>While product marketing often falls under the jurisdiction of a marketing department team to engage customers to buy directly from the company, product management, on the other hand, covers every purview about the product’s entire cycle from its manufacturer to sale and even more to the final consumer. Click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/marketing-sales/marketing-promotion/marketing-basics/seven-ps-marketing&amp;ved=2ahUKEwisvrPV_rHnAhXRQkEAHdrkCHUQFjAMegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MIVjo8zSuA7AVNpz12Vzo&amp;cshid=1580617774561">here</a> if you’d like to have deeper, in-depth knowledge about the 7 P&#8217;s of product marketing strategy</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding the 7 P&#8217;s of Product Marketing Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Professional product marketers often refer to some precepts while dealing with business. These precepts are the basis on which strategies are built.  To the non-initiate, it is simply the “Seven Ps” of marketing, but to kick-ass marketers, it is the seven pillars of commerce.  Let’s delve deeper to see the reason behind this notion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Product</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin with, you cannot go into marketing without having a specific product or products in mind. Meanwhile, your products might span across different things depending on the kind of company you operate on.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the product, you’re into, you stand a better chance of leveraging your product by integrating the seven Ps for better sales. More importantly, you stand a better chance when you know the product you’re dealing with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next on our list of seven Ps is pricing. It is important to know that you just cannot fail to consider pricing when you already have your product. Even if you don’t have many competitions, you have to consider pricing in such a way that your customers are overly considered and they can be influenced overly to patronize you.</p>
<p>At this point, it is just more than setting a price tag on a product and expects your customers to pay. No, it goes way beyond that. This time, you have to overly consider whether or not the general market ecosystem satisfies with your product and the subsequent pricing. Here, you’ve got to answer wavering questions like &#8211; How much is my product overly in demand? How well does my pricing fit into my potential customers&#8217; budget? Do I have people selling the same products, if yes, what’s their pricing like? These and many other questions are the questions that should ravage through your mind as you set your pricing for your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Place</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the laymen, place refers solely to the location as far as product marketing is concerned, but then it goes way beyond that. Actually, they refer to the distribution strategy you have out in place to get your product across to your customers.  It refers to the channel put in place to make sure that once your product is already known, and your price set, you can get to your specific customers without any hassles. That way, you have them coming back to patronize your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every of the seven Ps in product marketing is important but then, we must pay close attention to the fourth P, Promotion.</p>
<p>More than just advertising, promotion goes deeper as to how your product is presented to the outside world. Does your product sit well in the mind of the consumers when it is been advertise? How much of a solid influence does your product have? How many customers seeing your ad are more willing to take the step to patronize you? These and many other questions are what make up your promotion. Although it is advertising, it is however basically on another level entirely. This time, it covers brand awareness, lead acquisition, demand generation, product differentiation as well as product messaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Process</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The product marketing process is the absoluteness that links the product marketing campaign to their major consumers. Simply put, the process in product marketing refers to the “conditions” put in place by the project team/ manager for customers to complete before getting a product.  This time around, it encompasses the other four Ps – the Product, Pricing, Place And Promotion. Hence, it makes way more easy to know who your real customers are and help you devise a method to keep them glued to you while you source for more patronage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>People</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, other Ps are useless without this P. Don’t get it all wrong. Other P&#8217;s are just as important as each other. but then, without people, then theirs is no market. You have this P happening straight from the production chain of delivery to the very last P of physical evidence. People are needed to make up the team that would deliver the product. You need people with quality and skills that can help make the product a success, even in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>Also, people are needed in distributing your product to the right consumers. People are needed to advertise your business. You need people to consume your product. In short, your product needs people to fully the right pricing. Of course, the sole reason your marketing team is working so hard is basically because of making sales. So, it is close to impossible to refuse not to be concerned about people when dealing with marketing. They are the bedrock to determine whether you’ll advance in the commerce spree or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Physical evidence</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find read the sixth P, about people, then you probably know we will be addressing “Physical Evidence” as our final P.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, there have been growing concerns about Erectile Dysfunction in young men. Lots of people have had one thing or more to say about it. Some have talked about how dysfunction negatively impacts their lives or people close to them. Thus prompting the thoughts of whether or not this dysfunction is a thing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ED is expected to happen in more men who are more advanced innate than their younger counterparts. But then, medical statistics have proven that quite a lot of young men in their prime report problems about erectile dysfunction. And this situation has left us wondering why such is the case.</p>
<p>The research of ED in men uses an age-bracket of 40 for determining the cut-off point for the term “young.” This arbitrarily constructs that the male folks within the teenage age of 18-40 are considered young. Unless otherwise specified, we&#8217;ll be referring to them as such from this article henceforth.</p>
<h2>How Common Do Young Men Experience Erectile Dysfunction?</h2>
<p>As opposed to initial medical studies from the World Health Organization journal on Erectile dysfunction in young men. The number of affected persons has drastically risen than it used to be. Reports show that more than 26% of men who undertake ED treatment are below 40 years of age.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/dealing-and-avoiding-kidney-stones/">Dealing and Avoiding Kidney Stones</a></h2>
<p>From every indication, this picture is quite worrisome. This is telling us that more than we expect. It means that the number of affected young men suffering from ED is on the rise.  And there’s a need for us to deal with this problem before it eats deeper than it has already done. How do we go about this? We&#8217;d discuss that soon enough. But first, we have to deal with the factors that relate to ED in younger men.</p>
<h2>Causes of Erectile Dysfunction in Younger Men</h2>
<p>According to extensive researches carried out about young people with erectile dysfunction. There are lots of suggestions indicating that the same factors resulting in ED in older can constitute the same problem for the younger ones. Some considered examples include depression, anxiety, partner-related emotions, and lack of sexual stimuli or attraction toward the opposite sex. These are liable to cause psychological imbalance. It can result in dysfunction while physical symptoms related to hormones, cardiovascular, and metabolic functioning can also result in a more incremental, adverse impact for any man, irrespective of the age.</p>
<p>Let’s go into details. Outlined below are some of the factors that could lead to ED in younger men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Physical Factors</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is one factor we just can not do without mentioning first.  What we eat, drink and generally ingest have the potentials to make or mar us. So then, it isn’t a surprise this is taking the lead in our list of factors leading to ED in young men.</p>
<p>In a bid to explore how consumables cause ED in younger men, medical authors of Sexual Medicine journals revealed that a good number of men with ED were the ones that weren’t wary of the food and things they ingest. The study proved that young men that partied in taking unhealthy foods and drinks which includes alcohol and cigarettes are at the risk of getting ED than their counterparts that ate healthy consumables.</p>
<p>Other physical factors worthy of consideration include lack of adequate exercise, stress, and lack of personal hygiene. Most men who don’t participate in taking exercises frequently, or are overly stressed out after work or any activity are more likely to have ED owing that they don’t have the physical fortitude to maintain an erection. Also, poor personal hygiene from either the person involved or their partners can negatively influence the sexual life of younger men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Psychological Factors</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next part we&#8217;d be discussing is the mental causes of ED in younger men. Usually, this factor isn’t always considered owing that the patients involved didn’t take full consideration of it.</p>
<p>The truth is, once the psychological balance over sex isn’t properly regulated, the grit to perform sexually is depleted to minimal. Simply put, a depressed, overly anxious man will underperform sexually.</p>
<p>Although this researches might be kind of spontaneous, there’s a strong medical suggestion that young men&#8217;s intuitions of their genitals and how to manage sexual psychology can help foster sexual performance. This can positively impact ED in younger men than ever before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone suddenly falls on the floor, his breath is palpitating quickly, your guess the person is trying to catch his breath by all means. What would you do at this moment? Would you scream for help or would you just stand there numb? Perhaps you have no idea what to do. Well if you see such, anytime and any day then you’ve just seen someone who is having a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Here are the signs, especially if you suspect a loved one of yours;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unable to respond</strong>: The person is unable to respond even if you tap him or her so hard on the shoulders. Or if you scream his name, he’s unable to hear you. There’s absolutely no reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Increased palpitation</strong>: the person is either breathing fast, gasping for air, or not breathing at all; then here is time to act.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Act Quickly as it might be a cardiac arrest</h2>
<p>If you have tried all means physically, like; slapping, hitting and yelling the person’s name and he or she refuses to respond. Then there is a great tendency he or she is suffering from a cardiac arrest. Here’s what to do at such a moment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If people are around you or you’ve got neighbors, please scream for help immediately</strong>: Tell someone nearby to call the emergency care line and ask a person or another to bring an AED (automated external defibrillator), and that’s if there’s any presently. Everyone around you, especially YOU would need to be quick in response because time is of the essence at this moment. And if you’re alone and suspect the person you’re with has signs of cardiac arrest, then you’ll have to call the emergency care unit at once and get an AED if you have one at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-physical-therapy/">What you need to know about physical therapy</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observe rhythmic breathing</strong>: if the person is either gasping or not breathing at all, then administer a CPR quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Use an AED NOW:</strong> use this device as soon as it arrives. Turn it on and follow the instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Give a quick CPR</strong>: place your palm above each other (make sure both palms are together in the form of a fist) on his or her chest and push down at least 2 inches at a rate of 101 to 121 pushes a minute or two. Make sure is in the center of the chest and allow the chest to come back to its normal position after each soft press.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t give up, PLEASE</strong>: Continue with the CPR, until you see the person either move or breathe again or until a person with more advanced knowledge or training takes over from you, for example, an emergency response team member or EMS team member.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Here’s why you should learn CPR</h2>
<p>There is a high call for people to learn CPR, and that’s because the survival rates for victims with cardiac arrest is still worryingly low.</p>
<p>It is estimated that less than one in ten people survive a cardiac arrest, this is a shock to all medical personnel. You may want to ask why? Here’s why, the solution to this surprisingly sudden problem, is at the same time surprisingly easy. And that’s simply applying a simple CPR on the victim.</p>
<p>Every minute that passes by without the application of CPR can reduce the victim’s chance of ever surviving a cardiac arrest by around 10%.</p>
<p>So in essence, if CPR is taught to people, it could help save hundreds, even thousands of lives annually.</p>
<p>“We wish all young men and women feel confident and willing to help when faced with a first aid emergency, “said Joe Mulligan, head of first aid education at the British Red Cross.</p>
<h2>Learning First Aid treatment of Cardiac Arrest</h2>
<p>First of all, you have to know that learning first aid definitely helps to increase a person’s confidence, and we believe it’s a life skill and a necessity that everyone should have or apply.</p>
<p>Now it comes down to you the reader, you should have the opportunity to learn first aid throughout your life, if fortunately, beginning from your school, so that generations of people can be equipped with the skill or training they need to help when there is a need for a quick response or in an emergency.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of free teaching resources on paper and online, not to forget workshops; if you wish to make it practical. Most of these workshops are designed to give young people the confidence, willingness, and the skill to act in times of emergency.</p>
<p>According to Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director for NHS, England. He said, “When one in five people witness someone fainting and who clearly needs CPR. The majority of people have no idea what to do at such a moment.”</p>
<p>This shows that teaching CPR to school children equips them with the needed knowledge, that’ll help them to act in times of need. It breeds confident youngsters in the society, also allowing them to be the hero for the moment. And that can be thrilling to them.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>To sum it all up, there needs to be mandatory training for all young and old people. Mostly, in the skill of administering CPR to victims of cardiac arrest. This surely would improve the rate of survival.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows how dangerous an asthma attack is. It is as dangerous as death itself. To combat this, most asthmatics rely on inhalers as the medication for managing their symptoms when they are under attack. So far, it has proven to be extensively effective.</p>
<p>For healthy reasons, asthmatic patients have had a cause to always keep their inhaler within reach. But then, they are humans as well and are prone to have situations when the inhaler isn’t within grasp.</p>
<p>During this moment, it can be quite hazardous for the patient to manage through if the attack hits in. They&#8217;d find it extremely distressing to control and if not properly handled, it can result in more complex complications.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some nonmedical means to help regulate breathing until the patient is able to access their medication. How? We&#8217;ll be discussing that in this article.</p>
<p>First off, it’d be great if we started off with explaining what asthma means.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Asthma?</strong></h2>
<p>Asthma is a health condition whereby the airway is thinned, swell and produce extra mucus. Once it hits, breathing becomes more difficult, coughing is triggered as well as wheezing and breath shortness.</p>
<p>Asthmatic attacks don’t just happen. They are usually triggered by varieties of things which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroach Waste</li>
<li>Dust</li>
<li>Indoor and outdoor mold</li>
<li>Pollen,</li>
<li>Pet dander.</li>
<li>Weather change – Quite interesting, weather changes can cause asthmatic attacks.</li>
<li>Air pollution: Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, smoke, paint fumes, and diesel particles as well as other cleaning products have the capacity to trigger asthma.</li>
<li>Tobacco smoke.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/what-we-should-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/">What we should know about the new coronavirus</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Stress and Anxiety</li>
<li>Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have the capacity to trigger 5% of adult asthma patients.</li>
<li>Yelling, Laughing, Crying, Exercises and other activities that affect breathing can trigger asthma.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Managing Asthmatic Conditions</strong></h2>
<p>As aforementioned, there are some simple non-pharmaceutical tricks to manage asthma.</p>
<p>However, in the case that you experience any of the following symptoms, you’d do well by seeking emergency medical assistance as swiftly as you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty in breathing properly or stopped breathing.</li>
<li>Rapid pulse</li>
<li>Severe Anxiety</li>
<li>Bluish color to the lips and face, called cyanosis</li>
<li>Sweating profusely.</li>
<li>Reduced level of consciousness, such as somnolence or confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to deal with a mild asthmatic attack without an inhaler </strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Sit Upright</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you don’t have any business lying down or hunching over. Else, you risk having a restricted flow of air from and to your lungs. Rather, sit uprightly with your back straight. This way, your lungs will be kept open and more amount of air can flow through your respiratory systems.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Take Quick, Deep Breaths</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When under attack, your heart rate tends to be marginally unbalanced and this isn’t good for you. So, take in breaths to help control your heartbeat and free off any tension you have in your chest. Sit upwards and inhale deep, belly breaths through your nose and exhale through it through your mouth.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Remain as calm as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an asthmatic patient, you have to do away with every form of stress and anxiety as it tends to trigger or even worsen asthmatic attacks. Stay composed by taking deep breaths, and visualize what your next action should be.  You stand a better chance if you have someone with you to comfort you to be at peace. This would help bring down the attack.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Keep your nutrients around </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Having certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C and magnesium, is a good way of managing asthma symptoms. Due to the bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects of magnesium, medical practitioners encourage it to be used as adjuvant therapy for child asthmatics. Some medical studies even claim that adequate usage of vitamin C has the capacity to drastically reduce exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Avoid Asthma Triggers as much as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, you already know this but then, you might be able to control this when you’re under attack. Try everything your capacity to get away from possible triggers without you having to over-exert yourself. Be open to asking for help if you’re unable to get it done by yourself.  Try as much as you can and get to a  more filtered, temperature-controlled air and shade area.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Coffee is good</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Medical practitioners have over the years discovered that caffeine has the capacity to modestly improve airways function as much as four hours. This also offers to people without asthma. Actually, Caffeine metabolizes into theophylline that aids in dealing with and preventing asthma while relaxing the airway. Be careful with this as it does have the potential of speeding up your heart rate which can result in hyperventilating.  A cup or two is enough to keep you stable. Read more about it <a href="https://www.drugs.com/cg/hyperventilation-discharge-care.html">here</a></p>
<h3><strong>Bottom line</strong></h3>
<p>Asthma can be life-threatening especially when it has done beyond being mild to more severe symptoms. Hence, it is advisable that you keep your inhaler with you always. Also, you’d have to be around friends and people that understand your health condition so that they can help rejuvenate you when you pass out, have breathing problems or begin to hyperventilate. Remember, you might not be able to do each of these things yourself, you need people to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to extensive health research from the World Health Organization, (WHO) more than 10% of the total global population risk having kidney stones over the course of a lifetime. In recent times, the risk percent seem to have grown massively.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are serious misconceptions as to the causes of kidney stones even amongst elites. To deal with this, this article outlines the major causes and prevention of kidney stones.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-stones%23risk-factors&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8z5W2iq3nAhVLi1wKHaDDBLoQpYkCKAEwDnoECA0QCA&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wNYnpdEL21K9HcAyBbMkV">here</a> to learn more about the risk factors of kidney stones and how to avoid them.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Causes of Kidney stones and solutions</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Sweat Carefully</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Exercises are healthy for health. They help to stay fit and agile for other activities. But then, they have the potential of resulting in kidney stones. How’s this possible? Actually, when you sweat, you lose a lot of water either through the summer heat or exercise thereby causing you to urinate less than normal. The more sweat you produce, the less urine you produce, thus allowing stone causing materials to remain in the body system and bond to the urinary tract and the kidney.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/why-fiber-is-essential-for-a-healthy-diet/">Why Fiber is Essential for a Healthy Diet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution: </strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drink enough water. One of the most potent days of dealing with replenishing excessive water loss through sweat is through water hydration. This way, you’ll get to urinate more frequently than when you don’t hydrate enough.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>The effects of oxalate-rich food</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of ingestible foods contain oxalates. Foods like peanuts, chocolate, rhubarb, beets, spinach as well as sweet potatoes are examples of food relatively rich in oxalates. Moderately eating these foods may be beneficial for people with calcium oxalate stones, the leading type of kidney stones. However, one major misconception is that the reduction of oxalate-rich foods will rescue the chance of calcium oxalate kidney stones. Theoretically, this might be correct but it isn’t from an overall health perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid oxalate kidney stones, make sure to eat oxalate-rich food alongside adequate calcium in every of your diet. This way, both calcium, and oxalate can bind together in the stomach and intestine before being processed to the kidney, hence giving a lower probability for kidney stones to be formed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Eat enough Calcium: </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the time when you see people talk about kidney stones, they often find a way to wrap it around calcium-rich food. They see it as the culprit in calcium-oxalate stones. But then, they are extremely wrong. Rather, a calcium-diet increases the risk of developing kidney stones.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to cut down on your intake of calcium. Rather, work towards reducing the sodium and oxalates in your diet. If you must eat oxalate-rich foods, make sure to pair it with calcium-rich food to reduce the effect of oxalates on the internal organs.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>One Kidney stone influences getting another</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A kidney stone experience is one heck of a painful one. You don’t get it once and for all. Rather you stand the risk of getting more. While a lot of people will do everything they can not to have it again, it is almost impossible for it not to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Act now! If you dont utilize the correct medication and take the right diet adjustment, you stand the risk of having the stones coming back, and this time it might even be worse and can result in more complex problems like kidney disease.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Kidney stones vary.</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from the common calcium oxalate times, another type of kidney stone is the uric acid stones. Usually, this type of stone can be gotten from red meat, organ meats, and shellfish owning to their natural chemical compound known as purines. The intake of purine in large quantities can result in higher production of uric acid which can lead to a larger acid load for the kidneys to purge out. The higher the excretion of uric acid, the lower the alkaline level of the overall urine, this making the urine more acidic. A more concentrated acidic urine is a major opening for uric acid stones to form easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other to prevent the formation of uric acid stones, it is important that you reduce the intake of food high on purine. The likes of organ meat, shellfish, and red meat should be cut down drastically. Thereafter, you’d have to choose more vegetative eating and eat more healthily.  Your diet should contain more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, as well as low-fat dairy products. More importantly, you have to cut down on how you drink sugar-sweetened foods and drinks, especially the ones with a high level of fructose corn syrup. As expected, you’d have to do away with alcoholic beverages and drinks as it has the potential of increasing the uric acid levels in the blood and avoid crash diets for the same reason. Disciplining against eating less animal-based protein and ingesting more fruits vegetables and fruits increases your chance of reducing stone formation while decreasing the acidity in the urine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, cleanses and detox diets have grown to become trendy among people seeking to lead a healthy lifestyle. Actually it does point out to rid the body off toxins materials.</p>
<p>More importantly, detoxes don’t base solely on a toxin-ridding protocol, instead, it has included a kind of strategy to reset meals and filter it to less junk and more nutrient. But then, there have been speculative claims that detox and cleanses offers are sham and all a hype from what it actually promises.</p>
<p>How true is this claim?</p>
<p>Well, in as much detox are meant to put you in the habit of healthy eating, it does come with its own residual effect which can be avoided if you maintain proper protocols and eat balanced diets. But rather than delve into the residual side effects of detoxes and cleanses, let’s delve into what they actually promise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>What Does Detox Promise?</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, detoxes are there to rid your body of every harmful substance. Sometimes, they concern with a particular part in the body like the liver, kidney or lungs. All in all, detoxification helps you feel better.</p>
<p>To actualize this, cleanses (or detoxes as you might choose to refer them as) makes it compulsory to make sure that you don’t get to eat some specific kinds of food or drink some kind of juice. According to cleanses, these junk and unhealthy drinks are poisonous and are liable to pollute the body. More than just food intake, detoxes aims at making sure that the body ride of excessive addiction, drugs inclusive.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid-hype-or-hope/">Hyaluronic Acid – Hype or Hope?</a></h2>
<p>Presently, there are more than enough cleanses available in the market today that you may end up being confused if you don’t have a specific one in mind to purchase. But whichever one you buy, make sure it has the capacity to adequately cleanse the body system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>What happens when you detox your body? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, we understand the importance of vegetables and fruits to our body system. Hence, ingesting an adequate amount of these two, taking a good amount of detoxifiers and following a particular feeding logic will leave you super healthy.</p>
<p>But then, you can’t combine to live on that forever, else, you risk having excessive loss of weight.</p>
<p>Actually, water is saved up in your muscles with glycogen. So when you continue to eat a diet low in calories for a long time, it will prompt your body to use up glycogen stores easily and get to lose water weight alongside it. Hence, it is very important that you eat the appropriate proportion of food nutrients while on detox. This would enable you to gain back other vital nutrients such as fat, fiber, and protein.</p>
<p>Highlighted below are some of the underlying benefits of detox diets.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Weight Loss and Management</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One major goal of taking detox diets is the loss of weight.  In fact, it might be a very good morality to jumpstart your progress. Interestingly, you can as well inculcate it in your long-term weight management. With proper detox, you sure will be able to keep your body shape in check.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Increased Energy</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nobody likes to get fatigued for a long time. It’s always a good thing to be able to get through your daily activities and balance it with work and pleasure. Detox diets help you achieve just that.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Internal Organs</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the primary reason of taking detox is to purify your body system, you can be sure that your organs would be overly affected by the outcome. Hence, you can be sure that the internal organs will rid off excess waste and make your body system as great as new. This way, you can be sure to function optimally.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Functional Immune System</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since the primary function of the detox is to relieve your organs from excess workload, your immune system can do a better job to protect your body from external bodies and illness. In this case, your body will be able to absorb rich nutrients faster.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Improved thinking</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are unable to get a clearer, straightforward and solid memory and would want to do something to enhance it,  detoxing is your best option.</p>
<p>From this, we can deduce that the benefits of detoxing aren’t just physical importance. In fact, it aims at taking care of the psychological part of the human body as well. For optimal results, you can get to include meditation into your detox plan. Yes, it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Importantly, sugar crashes and other adverse effects of a toxic diet has the potential to affect your mind. However, if you’re able to explore the detox aspect benefit, it would be almost impossible to go back to an unhealthy lifestyle.  In case you’d want to read more about the benefits of detoxification, you can read it up <a href="https://classifieds.usatoday.com/blog/business/10-important-benefits-detoxing-body/">here</a>.</p>
<p>With the proper detoxing process, you’d be able to gather enough muscle tissue and not continue to run on fumes as most detox counter-studies suggest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, technology is making healthcare more accessible and affordable to the mass. So far, scientists have come up with technologies that can help humans attain good health. From genomics to 3D bioprinting, etc. The innovation continues.</p>
<p>Through these technologies, scientists have discovered various ways that help humans live longer, more productive, and healthier lives.</p>
<p>Even with all these been said, less has been talked about on ways these health technologies have influenced the healthcare industry. Again, it is important to discuss how these technologies will be more accessible to locations having challenges in accessing adequate healthcare.</p>
<p>The digital health industry recently provides few insights into the various changes it has on healthcare. Below are ways of how technology is currently making healthcare more accessible to the masses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Ways Technology Is Making Healthcare More Accessible And Affordable</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Remote visits by doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a fact that people living in rural areas lack easy access to quality and adequate healthcare. According to recent statistics, about 10% of the doctors living in the US are available in rural areas, posing a serious problem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>Now, telemedicine was innovated to solve these major challenges. It does this by providing a system of various remote medical consultations. With this development, patients can always speak with a healthcare provider by means of electronic &#8211; often phone or video.</p>
<p>Today, this field is growing strongly. It&#8217;s currently been used by more than a million people. These services seem to be a lot cheaper than the in-person system of doctor visits. It means individuals with low income can afford to speak with doctors. Today, millions of Americans are currently lacking health insurance.</p>
<p>Although the services rendered via telemedicine cannot treat all ailments. They are an effective and flourishing alternative to the need for frequent doctor visits. It only requires the assessment of symptoms and some prescriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Artificial intelligence doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is truly changing how many things are done. That is even in the healthcare industry. Although, some people may feel reluctant to consult with an AI doctor. Even if this is the case, this type of technology can still be more reputable than it could be imagined.</p>
<p>Just recently, artificial intelligence defeated some human doctors in a clinical exam. The British firm Babylon and other companies are striving to develop some applications that could help users obtain medical advice. This is from the comfort of their mobile devices.</p>
<p>AI technology is also capable of learning over a long period of time while building more experience. This will help people to have access to medical advice easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>The use of remote monitoring</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the help of health technology,  healthcare providers now find it easier to monitor the health status of their patients remotely. This now eliminates the need for patients to always visit their doctors face-to-face for follow-ups.  That is after which the treatment of a particular condition.</p>
<p>Today, there are different sorts of technologies that enable this to be possible. Some of the well-known applications are used for uploading information like blood sugar readings to healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Also, patients could wear devices that measure and give instant records. Most are wireless devices for transmitting information needed by the medical team. Home monitoring devices can also be used by senior citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Use of some personal health applications</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many personal apps have been created in many industries for health. This has also solved some problems. Today, lots of personal health apps can be found in the marketplace. They are mainly built for the purpose of helping people organize certain medical information.</p>
<p>With them, consumers can easily store important personal health information. There are many useful things these digital health tools can be used for. Combining different health apps can almost serve one as a personal doctor.</p>
<p>This health technology helps consumers take personal health into their hands. They offer 24/7 access to different medical pieces of information that are useful in making decisions when a doctor isn&#8217;t available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>E-consultation for doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As many of the medical specialists practice in urban areas, those residing in rural areas must travel long distances for serious health issues. For one, it is time-consuming and quite expensive. The innovation of some electronic consultations has solved this problem, to an extent. Now, there are tools for video conferencing which are used by primary care physicians located in rural areas. This allows them to virtually speak with those specialists.</p>
<p>With a tool like this, the physicians will gain the required knowledge for helping their patients. This means the patient doesn&#8217;t need to travel to visit a specialist.</p>
<p>As modern technology continues to be useful in many areas of healthcare, uninsured individuals, low-income earners, and people residing in rural areas will be getting more access to the quality healthcare they deserve.</p>
<p>Here is how health technologies are reducing <a href="https://tincture.io/healthcare-technologies-reducing-risk-increasing-access-fded547517e0?gi=a35624840093">dangerous health risks</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, there have been global growing anxieties about the new, widespread coronavirus. According to global reports, the number of infected patients has increasingly risen and there are other suggestive reports of other isolated places across the world, owing to international travels.</p>
<p>This deadly disease was discovered in Wuhan, a sub-city in China in 2019. Since then, over 1300 cases of the diseases have been reported, and not less than 40 deaths recorded.</p>
<p>However, the government of many countries has charged their public health officials to put measures in place to efficiently put a stop of the virus. In a bid to justify this move, there have been temporary travel restrictions to and from Wuhan, China. In more mild cases of emergency travels, strict health screening measures have been put in place to curtail the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>However, with the ever-evolving information and news about this deadly virus, it wouldn’t be out of place if you’re worried. You’re concerned as to what to do, and what not to do. How do you avoid it? Can it be treated? These and many other questions are what are plaguing your thoughts.</p>
<p>Anyways, we’ve done justice to your worries. In this article, we have highlighted notable information to enable you to gain more insight into the virus. Take your time to read through and you can be sure to stay safe. For more history and information about the coronavirus, read <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">here</a> or wait for subsequent posts about it on this platform.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a coronavirus?</strong></h2>
<p>Actually, there is no specific clarity about what  coronaviruses are. However, some medical experts choose to explain it as an awfully widespread cause of colds as well as upper respiratory infections. Usually, these viruses are zoonoses, meaning that they have the capacity to spread from certain animals to another, and in more severe cases, spread to humans especially if there are occurrence changes in the virus.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the health authorities in China received lots of reported groups of pneumonia sicknesses in late December 2019. Further researches exposed that most of the sick people had come in contact with the animal and seafood market in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has been a major transfer from one person to the other, thereby resulting in an alarming widespread.</p>
<h2><strong>Symptoms of Coronavirus</strong></h2>
<p>The symptoms of the coronavirus vary. It could include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Possible fever</li>
</ul>
<p>In more severe cases, the likes of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting happen.</p>
<p>If discovered earlier, it can be treated and the patient recovers within a short while. However, the same can not be said for the elderly, very young ones or people with a weakened immune system. They can result in more serious complications such as pneumonia, and bronchitis.</p>
<h2><strong>Can the coronavirus be treated?  </strong></h2>
<p>As of now, there are no remedial solutions for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, scientists are working hand in hand with the global government, especially with the Chinese public health authorities to get a cure for the coronavirus. For critical cases, the patients are moved to specialized, aggressive care, in an intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Here is a list of countries where the coronavirus has been discovered.  If you can, avoid unnecessary visits to these countries and even if you must, make sure that you are properly sanitized and treated prior and after your visit.</p>
<ul>
<li>China</li>
<li>United States</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>South Korea</li>
<li>Taiwan</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Thailand</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Nepal</li>
<li>Vietnam</li>
<li>Hong Kong</li>
<li>Macau</li>
<li>Malaysia</li>
<li>Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>These are every day habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Make sure to cough or sneeze with a tissue, and then discard the tissue in a trash can.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces like doorknobs, tables, chairs, etc.</li>
<li>If someone coughs or sneezes around you, cover your nose and mouth with tissue paper/ then discard into the trash bin.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is believed that the virus is spread through coughing, sneezing, and touching of infected surfaces, so please do your best to avoid this as much as possible.</p>
<p>Avoid any animals they bring from there (alive or dead), avoid anything they bought from any seafood market or animal markets in China, and stay away from any animal products (such as fish, seafood or any uncooked meat).</p>
<h2><strong>Do you have to be bothered about catching it? </strong></h2>
<p>Well, unless you’ve had close contact with a coronavirus patient, you are probably safe as you can be. But then, you never can be too sure, hence you should visit a health center for proper checkup.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the widespread of this deadly virus owning to the complexity and pace of international travel, there is a great chance that the number of infections and death tolls will increase massively in days to come. Nevertheless, it is no reason to panic. But then, we have to be extremely careful about our daily activities. Adhering to the above hygiene processes will give you a better chance of staying safe. Moreover, as more information about this deadly virus become available, we are confident that health organizations around the world will get more details and strategies to help in curtailing the virus.</p>
