										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SHRM Versus HRM</strong></p>
<p>Organizations differ depending on their capabilities and resources. Regardless of the resources that a specific entity has, the concept of strategy plays a very essential role in company growth and expansion This is because it is through the strategy that organizations are capable of achieving sustainable or firm competitive advantage. The term strategy as applied in both corporate and human resource management goes beyond the aspect of competitive advantage. It, therefore, means specific, obtainable, and measurable plans that can be developed by company stakeholders. Here, these measurable plans could aim at linking the subordinates so that they can be in the position to achieve desired targets. Since the concept of strategy is wide, the research focuses on demonstrating its integration in human resource management.</p>
<p>Even though many people in societies confuse strategic human resource management (SHRM) with human resource management (HRM), the two phenomena are totally different. According to studies, SHRM refers to a management function that aligns human resource management practices, programmes, and polices with corporate strategies (Delery &amp; Roumpi, 2017). The core intention of this function is to ensure that organizations achieve their objectives without experiencing complexities. It does so by improving the entire business operations while maintaining organization culture. This culture can be associated with research, development, or innovation that could be of greater significance in enabling business enterprises to gain sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>There are various benefits that an organization can gain as a result of developing and implementing the managerial function of strategic human resource management. One of these benefits is related to job satisfaction. Just like customers in marketing management, employee needs and wants are catered by this management function. It is very hard for business operations to prosper when employees are not happy about remuneration and other employment benefits. SHRM exists to ensure that all issues related to employees are resolved towards maximum production. Therefore, employees will perform their responsibilities effectively since their satisfaction is of greater focus. Job and increased customer satisfaction are as a result of strategic human resource management. This means that customers and employees are valued as the cored resources that assist organizations in achieving maximum production.  Not only does SHRM is linked to organization production but also acts as an effective approach towards managing employees.</p>
<p>On the other side, human resource management (HRM) refers to the systematic way of managing employees or human resources. The article of <em>Fundamentals of Human Resource Management</em> also defines HRM is the practice that organizations develop and implements towards maximizing the manner at which employees perform (Noe et al., 2018). This is one of the strategies that business enterprises can adopt to become more productive and efficient. For instance, human resource management (HRM) has a wide variety of policies and principles that an entity can use in order to oversee the personnel. It is essential to demonstrate that this does not work in Isolation with organizational systems and policies. For this reason, HRM entails all the possible ways that can assist business enterprises in managing the skilled workforce.</p>
<p>There are several activities that are associated with the concept of human resource management (HRM).  Some of these human-oriented practices entail but are not limited to industrial relations, performance appraisal, recruiting, development and training, health as well as safety. If organizations can effectively consider these activities, then Stewart &amp; Brown (2019) argues that human resource practices and policies can be adjusted to facilitate corporate strategies. For organizations to adopt these effectively, there is a need for skilled manpower described as a human resource manager. This skilled professional is entitled to functions such as overseeing change, evaluation, managing employee relationships, monitoring, maintaining, developing, staffing, and planning.</p>
<p>Having clearly defined the meaning and importance of SHRM and HRM concepts, it is essential to highlight some of the key differences between the two. The core difference is based on the objective between SHRM and HRM. Strategic human resource management (SHRM) aims at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of employees towards enabling business enterprises to achieve their desired targets or goals. According to studies, some of the essential activities that can add value as long as SHRM is involved in organizational goals are employee retention, motivation, compensation, promotion, training, selection, and appraisal (Armstrong, 2016). On the other hand, HRM aims at employee compensation after an appropriate selection. This means that employees are entitled to employment benefits because of participating in organizational practices or operations.</p>
<p>Another difference between SHRM and HRM is related to governance and leadership. When it comes to strategic human resource management (SHRM), managers in all departments are coordinating employees and the operations they do. It is essential to demonstrate that this kind of governance is applicable to <em>all</em> managers who are involved in the daily operations of employees. These managers can be in strategic positions or any other department that is of greater significance in assisting the organizations in achieving organizational targets. In strategic HRM, the human resource manager acts as an imitator. This means that he or she is always seeking for the transformational category of leadership. On the other side of HRM, only the human resource department is responsible for employee coordination. When it comes to leadership, the human resource manager acts as a change follower. For this reason, he or she is capable of responding to changes through the transactional approach of leadership.</p>
<p>In addition, it becomes hard for the organization to prosper without appropriate strategies. Managers have to make vital decisions on matters regarding critical operations. The scope of decisions is another factor that can be used to differentiate strategic human resource management (SHRM) from human resource management (HRM). In SHRM, for instance, decisions related to the issues of employees are always proactive. Delery &amp; Roumpi, 2017) establishes that a proactive strategy of decision making allows human resource experts to anticipate core issues during employee training and staffing level. It is through effective anticipation that a human resource manager(s) can develop strategies for constant production. On the other side of HRM, decisions are reactive in nature. The reactive model, therefore, takes an immediate effect of responding to issues. This means that human resource issues are responded to as soon as they occur. If the organization experience low production as a result of poor employee training, for instance, then the human resource department utilizes its resources and efforts in developing effective solutions.</p>
<p>Organizations have different resources that are of greater significance when it comes to the attainment of goals. However, employees are termed as the core element that assists business enterprises in delivering their promises to customers. The manner at which employees are treated can be used as a dimension to demonstrate key differences between SHRM and HRM. Ideally, human resources are considered as a business partner in SHRM. Some studies believe argue that partnership does not only involve employers and employees but also as well (Bailey et al., 2018). Since human resources are perceived as internal customers in SHRM, they are handled with great care and respect. On the other side, the concept of human resource management considers human resources as &#8216;hired people or workers&#8217;. The consequences of this consideration are intense due to limited care and respect. Organizational performance seems to poor since there is no appropriate mechanism of motivation.</p>
<p>Just like the way the customer relationship management approach is used to maintain the relationships between customers and marketers, organizations may decide to adopt other approaches towards achieving sustainable performance and competitive advantage. However, the category of approach to be adopted depends on the type of concept implemented by the organization. For the managerial concept of SHRM to be successful, business enterprises ought to consider the integration approach. This approach aims at aligning the core business strategies with developed human resources practices for the organization. It is through effective alignment that corporate targets can be achieved without the organization facing challenges. On the other side of human resource management (HRM), business enterprises must follow the fragmentation approach. Here, the organization is forced to develop and implement management guidelines while overseeing human resources or employee.</p>
<p>In most cases, organizations fail in achieving corporate targets because of increased costs of operations. Not only does cost becomes the only factor that makes organizations lose their ambitions also a waste of resources and time. For instance, human resource managers waste a lot of time while supervising or controlling employees. The challenge of time wastage has been eliminated by the strategic human resource management function (SHRM). According to Armstrong (2016), it is through management guidelines or principles that human resource experts have eliminated the aspect of stringent control. The rationale behind the absence of stringent control is that rules associated with the management of manpower are lenient. While in human resource management (HRM), managers are exercise stringent control over the employees through supervision, monitoring, and other managerial activities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, organizations should always evaluate the capabilities and establish a strategic approach or function they develop and implement. If business enterprises agree to go with strategic human resource management (SHRM), then are several elements they should know. Such key elements entail a proactive style of decision making, integration approach, responsibility (departmental managers), employee treatment (business partner), no stringent control (management guidelines), and objective (efficiency and effectiveness of employees). On the other hand of human resource management (HRM), managers should consider critical elements like a reactive style of decision making, fragmentation approach, responsibility (human resource department), employee treatment (hired workers), presence of stringent control, and overall objective (employee compensation and selection).</p>

<h1><strong> COVID 19 IN EDUCATION SECTOR</strong></h1>
<p>coronavirus pandemic is a health crisis that  people are experiencing globally. It has posed a great challenge to the world as no cure has been found. This is due to its effects not only to the health sector but also to the socio-economic sectors. Most countries have decided and taken actions to alleviate the growth and development of a full-blown pandemic. Therefore countries have gone into localized closures. Schools, universities and all education systems have been closed down. As they can be a faster means of spreading the virus. This has resulted in home-schooling especially in countries that have been heavily affected. Countries such as Italy, Iran, and Korea. These changes in the education system have brought about inconveniences. However, innovation and invention within the sector get promption. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting influence on learning and its activities.</p>
<h3><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Growth in public-private educational partnerships</strong></a></h3>
<p>Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, there will be growth in public-private education partnerships. Different stakeholders within the education sector are on the lookout for solutions. In some countries, students engage in homeschooling. Where interactive applications is in use to enhance it. Others are using live television broadcasts. Where all learning materials are being made available. While in some, less innovative solutions are being implemented. Such as the use of Google Classroom where face to face instructions are given. All these solutions have assisted in keeping students busy while at home. Through the concept of digitization in education, learning anywhere, anytime might be the new trend in the education system.</p>
<p>The digital platforms that are being used are a result of combined efforts by learning coalitions and stakeholders. The stakeholders such as the government, education professionals, technology providers, and network providers. Through this education has received more attention. Going beyond the projects that are being funded by the government and non-profit social projects. Private organizations such as Microsoft and Google have developed a great interest and are investing in innovative education solutions. Both the private sector and government are arising to the authority of educated people. However, due to the pandemic, there is a limit on the carrying out of initiatives. However, it is evident that after the pandemic large-scale and cross-industry partnerships would be established. Involving the private and public sector with a common goal of providing education in the most convenient way.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Effects of the partnerships</strong></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/annual-report/mobilizing-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth of these partnerships has begun</a>. For example in China, the Ministry of Education has assembled diverse parties. Who have contributed to the development of a new cloud-based, online learning and broadcasting platform.  This has led also to the upgrading of the education infrastructure in China. Which has been led by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and other stakeholders. Also, in Hong Kong a readtogether platform has been developed. It is an association with over 60 education organizations, the media, professions in the entertainment industry, and publishers.  Through this platform, educational resources and materials are provided. Materials such as assessment tools, book chapters, videos, and free counseling services.  The association aims and making use and upholding the platform in the future even after the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The development of these partnerships will be a trend. This is especially in countries where the government has been predominantly providing education. However, policies and regulations will need to be put in place. They will contribute to the execution and implementation of common goals. This will provide a clear guideline of how the partnerships will work, the contribution of each party, how decisions will be made.  In these, a code of conduct is emphasizes, ways of handling and managing conflict and ways of reaching a consensus in the case of disagreements.

<p>A laboratory report is a document that explains the record of experimental findings. The findings on the objectives, the procedures, and the outcome must be specific and well stated so that readers could replicate the experiments.</p>
<p>The lab reports are documented to analyze and describe an experiment that delves into a scientific problem.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it might be impossible to depend on one explanation for your findings. So, is important that you present several relevant and potential interpretations as possible. For instance, if your result does not go with your hypothesis, they are still of great value because you can then prove that going by the context of your study, your argument was not reliable, and you can then proceed to other areas for research without going the same path.</p>
<p>Interestingly, can be an opportunity for others to research your hypothesis using different conditions. Besides, there may even be some hidden conditions that were not possible to control and isolate which you can use to back up your results</p>
<p>Importantly also, you need to consider the grammatical style and tone in which you present your report. Lab reports are more often than not written in the passive voice and makes use of the third person pronoun.</p>
<p>So, very recently, it is now acceptable to make use of the active voice, like “Larry and Jones (1976) carried out the study and also reference yourself where relevant “I hypothesized that….”</p>
<p>The Elements Of A Lab Report</p>
<p><strong>                          Title </strong></p>

<p>It is usually the last part of the research findings</p>
<p>It gives an overview of the research findings, and sometimes the conclusions</p>
<p><strong>                  Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This gives the necessary background to the experiment and tries to define relevant theories</p>
<p>It states the hypothesis and /or the problems</p>
<p>Here, the objectives are stated in a concise manner</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p>At this point, the materials used are described, types of equipment utilized, and the procedures used clearly explained</p>
<p>The flow charts of procedures should be included (where applicable), and the use of diagrams of the experimental analysis should be used also.</p>
<p>In the case where data is collected, properly outline any calculations or processing done on the data</p>
<p><strong>Results And Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Explain how the results were analyzed with error analysis</p>
<p>The use of tables of graphical presentation of the result is done here</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Interpretation of result in terms of the research questions/aims</p>
<p>Give a summary of the research findings and shortcomings</p>
<p>Recommend ways to overcome shortcomings and give future directions</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Let the audience be reminded of the problem investigated</p>

Nevertheless, seizures status epilepticus is known to be a severe form of complex seizures. Status epilepticus is a single or series of seizures without an interim recovery which lasts at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>EPIDEMIOLOGY</h2>
<p>It occurs mostly in small children six months to years.</p>
<h2>Morbidity and mortality</h2>
<p>There is low-risk mortality within children with simple febrile seizures. Complex seizures occurred to children who are less than one year . in other words it is triggered by temperature less than 39 degrees that lead to 2 fold increased mortality rate after the two years episode of seizures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is evidence of epilepsy in children diagnosed with febrile seizures in comparison to the general population. Complex febrile become a risk factor later In life, family history of epilepsy and developmental delay.</p>

<p>A book review is an essential part of essay writing in the world today. Some books that have widely been reviewed include; the famous Da Vinci arts and the history of Great Britain with famous rulers like King Edward. Book reviews have taken center stage in writing academic. Research analysis in the world today is highly dependent on book reviews. Below are some of the steps for a great book review.</p>
<h2><strong>So what are the steps for a book review?</strong></h2>
<p>In a book review, you are always asked to give diverging aspects of the story being told. So some of the factors include character analysis and the social and economic elements revealed in the book. Also, essential literature aspects like rhetorical questions and poetry are crucial aspects of a book review.</p>
<h2><strong>Characters.</strong></h2>
<p>One of the essential parts of a book review is outlining the characters. There are always characters on both sides; there are those who continually support progress, and on the other hand, there are those that do not help progress.</p>
<p>Characters are one of the most significant aspects to look at in a literature review. Because traits help to build the story, outlining all the roles in a book review helps to break down the book and help the readers understand the book review in question.</p>
<h2><strong>Summary.</strong></h2>
<p>The first and the most crucial part of a book review is a summary, and This is a small introductory part that helps to explain all that the book is about. You should also advise if one reads a prerequisite before reading the book so that they can understand it better. In writing errands, we have experts that shall help you create a proper book review since we have a couple of ENL writers who have been doing book reviews for quite a long period and are experts in writing book reviews.</p>
<h2> <strong>Scholarly reviews.</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Plot</strong></h2>
<p>In a book review, you are also supposed to outline the plot of the story. Directly the plot of the story shows the setting in which the book review was done and the character interpretation of the book review. The plot is a significant factor and a constituent of a book review and should never be left out. The scheme always helps to create an excellent essay that looks logical in its reasoning and activation. For any creative piece, it is still good to look at the plot of the story. In writing errands, we help you create great scenarios for various essays you write for us on our platform.</p>
<h2><strong>Your opinion</strong></h2>
<p>Your opinion profoundly matters in a<a href="https://www.litlovers.com/run-a-book-club/lead-a-book-club-discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> book review</a>. Some of the attributes you are supposed to fill in a book include your favorite character in the book review that you have You should also fill in the way you felt about the book and the way you thought about the book you are writing about. Some of the other factors you are supposed to say as your opinion include how you felt the mood in the book was. You should also write about how you felt about your favorite scenes in the book. In your own opinion, you should never forget to add the pros and cons of the book. You should also add what you would have loved the book to bring out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How To achieve high grades in your academic papers</strong></h2>
<p>The pressure between work and school is tough and this is where <a href="https://writingerrands.com/">https://writingerrands.com/</a></p>
<p>Comes in. Needless to say, you need a companion to highly increase your grades in school. Here are some of the steps to ensure tha t you can increase your grades in school.</p>
<h2><strong> Avoid procrastination</strong></h2>
<p>This is one of the worst habits one can have as a student. Even if the assignment is difficult you should ensure that you do it. That’s why we as writing errands help you improve your grades and support you on your way to achieve high grades. We have tutors who are always online and shall help you achieve higher grades as compared to other students since we are experts. We would advice you to ensure that you do not fear facing the challenge and use us to tackle the challenge since we are here to help you get that amazing grade.</p>
<h2><strong>Be careful on your choices </strong></h2>
<p>Before you select on any unit you should be keen to ensure that you have what it takes to handle that assignment. A majority of times there are always those selective units that you choose and hence before selecting on any unit you should always ensure that you know the contents of that unit and you can handle that specific unit. It is always advisable to approach a person who understand your course and ask queries concerning that unit.</p>
<h2><strong>Involve the best.</strong></h2>
<p>When choosing a homework helper you should always ensure that you look for the best. We writing errand s have classified ourselves as one of the best homework helpers in the world having helped over 1000 students graduate with very high grades in their respective careers. You should always ensure that you select the best homework helper. Look for people whjo pay attention to your requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>Instructions.</strong></h2>
<p>Following instructions as specified by your instructors always the number one way to stand out. One thing I came to learn is that instructions are never usually to hard to follow at any particular time. Always read and re-read the instructions before you set out on any paper.</p>
<p>Needless to say, juggling from work and school work is tricky since it is the main reason why people do not pass in their education. Managing your education is important since it will bring a reflection of high grades</p>
<h2><strong> Passion.</strong></h2>
<p>The first step towards passing in your education is ensuring that you have passion and love for the subject you are doing. Scientists say that you can be in a position to change your habit within sixty days. Even when you completely hate something you can tune your brain to like it within a period of three months. You can start by liking the teacher and being close to the teacher so that you can also be better at his or her subject.</p>
<h2><strong>Career choice.</strong></h2>
<p>When choosing the subjects you want to undertake you should always ensure they are consistent with the career choice you have chosen to avoid wasting time on irrelevancies. You can read and research more on a subject you love. The best careers are made out of passion and hard work. Choosing a career is a very important part of your life and hence you should always consult from people who are n experts in the specific career you are choosing.</p>
<h2> <strong>Consulting.</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Regularly checking on your portfolio.</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong> On an online class there is no friend who will keep you your toes and hence it is always advisable to ensure that you always look at your portfolio from the first week.
