										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At some point in life, we get interviewed, either formally or informally. Why? This is because it is an essential tool for determining the growth of your business. Mind you, we are not referring to a job interview alone. Rather, it is the kind of questioning conversation that reels out uniqueness and test of knowledge.</p>
<p>But then, how do we define an interview as good enough?</p>
<p>Actually, it isn’t really about publishing in a Q&amp;A format. It is instead a meaningful dialogue that helps propel you to achieving solid, and constructive opinions. In this case, every one of the parties is important. The interviewer is not less important than the person being interviewed, neither is the latter inferior to the former.</p>
<p>So, how can we achieve this?</p>
<p>Well, just as aforementioned, the interviewing questions have to be one that spikes a worthy and interesting conversation. I mean, who would want something to do with a boring questioner? Obviously, not many people can condone to this! And since the major purpose is to attract the audience to the platform, then you need to be able to give them more than what they are seeking. You need to have their attention and keep it glued to your platform. Never mind, I’ll take you through what you need to know to effortlessly write and ask the perfect questions for an interview.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/nine-essential-elements-of-a-great-content/">Nine Essential Elements of A Great Content</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Focus on Explanation. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>First on this list is focusing on explanation. For every of your question,  you need to be able to visualize whether the individual you’re interviewing understand the question and the concept behind it.  Don’t get this wrong! You don’t have to literally answer the question. Instead, you should focus on making sure that you carry the person along in such a way that he/she feels the excitement in the question.</p>
<p>In simpler words, you have to find the trigger of that conversation and inculcate into the question. Only then would you have succeeded in the first phase of writing a dialogue-fitting question.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Proper Preparation is a must. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to be able to grasp the original concept of every question, you should do your research about them to familiarize yourself with as much related setting as possible.</p>
<p>Just like the first point, getting familiar with the questions you’re spewing makes it much easier for you and the person being interviewed more comfortable around each other. You’ll make him/her strongly have that feeling that he/she has to give their best shot answer every time. As expected, it would be very much like an interesting discussion where both parties learn.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Avoid being passive </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For every question, your pen down, make sure that you keep the rule of “listen and observe” in mind. Ensure that every question carries the tone of activeness in them. Don’t be a passive interviewer, rather you should be an active participant, and that should begin straight from the questions you craft. Even if you’d have to throw in some boring questions in-between, you can still twist it to become more of a conversation that keeps you both going on an on. Apparently, you are already a master at crafting out your questions if you’re able to indulge the first two steps, inducing this part actually makes you more flexible and vast.</p>
<p>Understandable that you’ve done your research, and you’re coming in well prepared but then, you have to prove to the other person involved that you’ve taken out the time to understand everything you churned out. Your activeness is what sells you out at this point.   Make sure it happens to begin with your question.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>You can’t ask every question in an interview. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Take it from me &#8211; You can’t write down or ask every question that pops in your mind. No, that would be limiting you to the level of just another “ordinary” interviewer. Since that is not the plan, it is your responsibility to be cautious of the kind the question you write and make sure it doesn’t dent the “perfect” atmosphere you’ve built.</p>
<p>Highlighted below are the kind of questions you’re allowed to pen down.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Direct Questions – </em>Yes, you are allowed to ask the interviewee questions that hit the original concept of the interview. However, the questions should be directly active and might have the potentials of leading to another question.</li>
<li><em>Open and Closed Questions – </em>Usually, this kind of question is somewhat related to direct questions but they are quite different. It should be straight to the point. One answer, it doesn’t lead to another question.</li>
<li><em>Intrusive questions – </em>As an interviewer, you’re somehow permitted to be nosy. This is not to satisfy your curiosity overly but it is basically to suit the questioning mind of the audience. While this style of questioning isn’t really a bad idea, it would be better if you avoid it if you are not sure of what the interviewee&#8217;s response would seem like. To be on a more cautious side, it is best to get the person being interviewed to agree to certain private terms before questioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, those are the three types of questions you’re allowed to write down when planning to have a master-blaster interview. Whichever you chose to accept isn’t a problem but you have to make sure you’re not cajoling the other party to answer what they wouldn’t be comfortable answering and ensure that everything falls accordingly to the concept of the original outline.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>The Importance of an outline in an interview</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The last phase we’d be talking about here is the outline, the concept on which the interview questions fall. You can’t write out every question you have in mind in your questionnaire. You have to screen out the questions to ensure it falls on the original theme of the whole interview.  Hence, you need to plan your questions.  You need to plan based on recent situations or upcoming events.</p>
<p>Although, making references to the last isn’t much of a bad idea but you need to tone it down as much as you can. Some memories can be hurting, you know.  Once you’ve successfully done this, then your interviewee would easily blend with you and get flow extremely well all through the lasting period of the interview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For an interview to be effective, you need to master the art of <strong>writing good Questions for an Interview</strong>. Getting a great conversation with an influencer can provide you meaningful stories that can help you promote your brand or business.</p>
<p>Preparing good <strong>questions for an interview</strong> can transform into amazing stories.</p>
<p>In this article, you will learn the ropes to writing effective questions for that coming interview you want to host. Be prepared to have powerful content for your audience.</p>
<h3><strong>Six Strategies for Writing Questions for an Interview</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong>For a start, you need to understand the purpose of the interview. Also, ponder on what you really need from the person you want to interview &#8211; then proceed to the tips below. Enjoy!</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/245-2/">HOW TO GET HIGH GRADES IN SCHOOL.</a></h2>
<h3><strong>Do some research about your respondent </strong><strong>when </strong><strong>Writing Questions for an Interview</strong></h3>
<p>This step is very crucial if you want to write an effective question for an interview. Gather enough information about the interviewee.</p>
<p>Why is this so important? When you know about your respondent, his/her personality, failures and accomplishments, it will be easy for you to think of some solid questions that will provide good results.</p>
<p>Use the search engines online to search for the respondent. See if you can find other related articles about him/her. Jot down some information about their bio. Don&#8217;t also forget to highlight any specific area you would like to discuss with them. Remember, a little research goes a long away in achieving an effective interview, don&#8217;t neglect this step.</p>
<h3><strong>Your questions must be relevant</strong></h3>
<p>This is very important. Make sure your questions for an interview is relevant to the topic you are researching, including what you seek to find an answer to.</p>
<p>Whenever you are writing this type of question, pay attention to how each one will add to answering the question(s) you are researching. This also has to do with your understanding of the topic.</p>
<p>If a question is not relevant, come up with a different one.</p>
<h3><strong>Make them open-ended questions</strong></h3>
<p>The nature of questions to write for an interview should not be a yes-or-no. If you want to write effective questions for an interview, a yes-or-no answer should be avoided.</p>
<p>Instead, go for open-ended questions. For example, come up with good questions that will make your respondent(s) recall and explain vividly about a question you throw at him/her/them.</p>
<p>This type of question makes your candidate feel comfortable to have a smooth conversation with you. More engagement is enhanced, leading to an amazing interview session.</p>
<p>You can ask questions that start with phrases like &#8220;Tell me about&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;How would you describe&#8230;?&#8221; Open-ended questions like this will open doors for well-detailed information, it also provides you with cues of the best next questions to ask.</p>
<h3><strong>The questions must be clear</strong></h3>
<p>An unclear and vague question only leads to confusion.</p>
<p>The questions you are writing for an interview need to be crafted in simple and clear prose. Understanding is key, so you don&#8217;t want to bring any confusion about your question.</p>
<p>Always test your interview questions for clarity. You can give your questions to colleagues for review &#8211; to validate for clarity.</p>
<p>In case your respondent can&#8217;t still understand a question (during an interview), always rephrase it in order to aid clarity.</p>
<h3><strong>Imagine your respondent is a brilliant person</strong></h3>
<p>This is particular suitable for job hiring, it can be used for other types of interviews also. Consider coming up with questions that a capable and intelligent person could provide a smart answer(s) to. Some tough questions can also be entertained, especially if you will be dealing with really smart individuals.</p>
<p>During the question-writing process, pretend to be both the interviewer and interviewee at the same time. This role-playing makes you more creative with your questions.</p>
<p>Remember that you should be capable of answering your own questions, so practicing as the interviewee helps you easily create questions you could provide answers to.</p>
<p>If it was for a job interview, viewing your respondent as an intelligent person allows you to pose some challenging questions. This will let you know if they may be your best candidate for the job.</p>
<h3><strong>Consider questions that elicit emotions when </strong><strong>Writing Questions for an Interview</strong></h3>
<p>When you combine this with open-ended questions as discussed above, your interview session will be fun. Questions that bring out emotional responses are perfect.</p>
<p>In the writing process, pause and think if there are some things about your respondent that you can use to create responses based on feelings. For example, if your subject is an influencer, ask him/her to discuss the regular setbacks and failures before achieving success.</p>
<p>You can also use other questions to be discussed for formulating questions that can create an emotional response. Ask them using phrases like &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;what&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some good examples of these types of questions are: &#8220;So tell me, how do you really feel about it now? &#8220;What keeps you going when the going was tough? &#8220;Tell me why you felt like you&#8217;d never reach this goal? These are perfect feeling-based questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These strategies are very effective when <strong>writing questions for an interview</strong>. Ensure that you prepare this phase well. Whether you want to use it for job interviews or for an influential person, they are effective.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing great content depends on adequate skills; more importantly, the choices. The choices, however, contribute to the outcome of a piece. One involves putting in time and effort, in turn, generating an informative work. The other requires less effort and time. As a result, it yields poor outcome and is also a waste of time and resources.</p>
<h3><strong>Top Tips For Creating Great Content</strong></h3>
<p>Creating an excellent web post has gone beyond just writing. We usually have to generate an error and plagiarism-free write-ups back then, but it requires more than that as of now. Here, in this piece, the tips for ranking on top and generating traffic have been put to place.</p>
<h3><strong>Creating Original Write-ups</strong></h3>
<p>Search engines work uniquely in providing search results for readers. They do not just rank a page randomly. The content we see whenever we do a quick search went through a process before attaining that position. For example, Google ranking &#8211; Google is making plans to penalize websites with duplicate content. In other words, sites containing original content are likely to get rewarded. Duplicate content, on the other hand, receives no or fewer backlinks. That alone deprives the content of performing well.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-look-for-the-best-homework-help-site/">How To Look for The Best Homework Help Site.</a></h2>
<h3><strong>Create Catchy And Energetic Headlines</strong></h3>
<p>A strong and catchy headline is another thing to consider for uplifting content. Which is why it should explain write-ups with short and memorable words. A caption should have the potential to thrill readers. Copyblogger statistics show that only twenty percent of people read a post after checking through the headline. Hence, a good is creating a few ones and picking the best. At the same time, let&#8217;s not be hasty; Instead, ensure they are suitable. Generally, headlines matter a lot in content creation. Responsive ones trigger the reader to look into the piece.</p>
<h3><strong>Introducing Actionable Tips</strong></h3>
<p>Do something &#8211; check your last blog posts and observe if it provides readers with actionable advice. Providing the required information is somewhat reasonable, but enlightening readers on the application would do better. Good write-ups give readers a sensational feeling on how they can apply lessons learned after reading content. By adding actionable tips, readers will feel respected and get advice on using what they are learning. And if you notice, proposing information tips will spark ideas for most readers.</p>
<h3><strong>Creating An Answerable Great Content piece</strong></h3>
<p>Providing answers to daily issues are the main reason for writing an article. Put another way; readers often have expectations whenever they read a write-up. Hence, they look for answers to the issues encountered in our day-to-day activities. Without difficulty, Google provides solutions to any search made. So is it in the case of great content, it should be answerable. It&#8217;s almost the same as watching a video to learn something new.</p>
<h3><strong>Source Relevant Information</strong></h3>
<p>Assume we created a blog post for a fashion website, and thousands of readers go through it, then find an inaccuracy in the piece. Then, stop thinking. On a bright note, do you know the level of menace this can impose on a brand name? Hence, it&#8217;s best if we had in mind the necessity of sourcing relevant information. As we all know, the content of a site reflects the potential it possesses. Hence, ensuring accuracy whenever we enlighten readers should be a priority.</p>
<h3><strong>Improve Communication By Adding Images And Videos</strong></h3>
<p>People learn in different ways; some prefer texts, others absorb better with pictures and videos. Above all, using visual aids enhances understanding. Whether images, videos, or diagrams, lessons are made clear, compared to text only. Put another way, these things help in stretching and explaining emphasis. Notably, only introduce them to relevant scenarios and avoid random stock photos.</p>
<h3><strong>Be Concise if you want to write Great Content</strong></h3>
<p>Nobody would love it when they read something other than what they expect, or still fluffy content. Focusing on the main point of discussion and avoiding fluff is one of the best lessons learned. There&#8217;s nothing better than short and informative content. Avoid focusing on word count at first, and write based on ideas.</p>
<h3><strong>Write Engagingly</strong></h3>
<p>Writing descriptive pieces is one thing, and writing engaged content another. Every reader has perceptions. Some don&#8217;t feel contention with explicit material because of its composition. Instead, they want it spiced up interestingly. We can achieve this by proposing questions, having a promising introduction, and citing instances.</p>
<h3><strong>Update Content When It Is Due</strong></h3>
<p>Have you seen materials that keep readers anticipated? Well, they do well with traffic and lead generation. Often when introducing a blog post, we can conclude by notifying viewers to come back for more updates. This is usually suitable when talking about a famous story. Hence, thrilling readers with expectations would do better.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion </strong></h3>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t play by ear when writing great content. It is never easy, as time and effort need to be in place. A more straightforward approach involves writing on passionate subjects. That way, we out ideas together without hassle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How To achieve high grades in your academic papers</strong></h2>
<p>The pressure between work and school is tough and this is where <a href="https://writingerrands.com/">https://writingerrands.com/</a></p>
<p>Comes in. Needless to say, you need a companion to highly increase your grades in school. Here are some of the steps to ensure tha t you can increase your grades in school.</p>
<h2><strong> Avoid procrastination</strong></h2>
<p>This is one of the worst habits one can have as a student. Even if the assignment is difficult you should ensure that you do it. That’s why we as writing errands help you improve your grades and support you on your way to achieve high grades. We have tutors who are always online and shall help you achieve higher grades as compared to other students since we are experts. We would advice you to ensure that you do not fear facing the challenge and use us to tackle the challenge since we are here to help you get that amazing grade.</p>
<h2><strong>Be careful on your choices </strong></h2>
<p>Before you select on any unit you should be keen to ensure that you have what it takes to handle that assignment. A majority of times there are always those selective units that you choose and hence before selecting on any unit you should always ensure that you know the contents of that unit and you can handle that specific unit. It is always advisable to approach a person who understand your course and ask queries concerning that unit.</p>
<h2><strong>Involve the best.</strong></h2>
<p>When choosing a homework helper you should always ensure that you look for the best. We writing errand s have classified ourselves as one of the best homework helpers in the world having helped over 1000 students graduate with very high grades in their respective careers. You should always ensure that you select the best homework helper. Look for people whjo pay attention to your requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>Instructions.</strong></h2>
<p>Following instructions as specified by your instructors always the number one way to stand out. One thing I came to learn is that instructions are never usually to hard to follow at any particular time. Always read and re-read the instructions before you set out on any paper.</p>
<p>Needless to say, juggling from work and school work is tricky since it is the main reason why people do not pass in their education. Managing your education is important since it will bring a reflection of high grades</p>
<h2><strong> Passion.</strong></h2>
<p>The first step towards passing in your education is ensuring that you have passion and love for the subject you are doing. Scientists say that you can be in a position to change your habit within sixty days. Even when you completely hate something you can tune your brain to like it within a period of three months. You can start by liking the teacher and being close to the teacher so that you can also be better at his or her subject.</p>
<h2><strong>Career choice.</strong></h2>
<p>When choosing the subjects you want to undertake you should always ensure they are consistent with the career choice you have chosen to avoid wasting time on irrelevancies. You can read and research more on a subject you love. The best careers are made out of passion and hard work. Choosing a career is a very important part of your life and hence you should always consult from people who are n experts in the specific career you are choosing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How to plan your essay.</strong></h2>
<p>When writing your essay, there are specific steps you are supposed to follow. At <a href="https://.www.writingerrands.com">https://.ww.writingerrands.com</a> Every step is essential in the literary analysis of your paper. There are particular steps you are supposed to follow in order when planning your essay.</p>
<p>When reading, you should always ensure that you keep a log of all the books that you are reading at any particular time. The schedule will help you save a track of all the books you are reading at any specific time and sort out which books are better than the others and help you have a statistical picture of all the books you are reading at any particular time.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The first step is looking for a topic.</strong></h2>
<p>A topic is simply the summary of the whole article you are writing in your academic research paper. The text should never be too long, neither short and hence should contain like six words to make the topic that you need for your literature analysis. In a majority of academic essays, you given the question. However, in other literature analysis, you need to create the required topic in the article that you are writing. An item should be a summary of all that you are doing in the essay. Remember, the topic part of the essay should also be the running head in the article. A topic should never be too long nor too short. Depending on your lecturer or the discipline that you are doing, the question may slightly vary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Introduction.</strong></h2>
<p>The first part of any essay is usually the introduction, which gives a summary review of all that you want to talk about in your article. The introduction part comes just below the cover page. However, if you have an abstract, the introduction usually only comes below the abstract. The presentation helps to brainstorm the reader on what he or she is to expect in the essay.</p>
<h2><strong>Body part</strong></h2>
<p>The body part of the essay is the meat part. Now, this is where the actual answer regarding the topic in question. The body part of any academic essay should contain roughly around 70% of the article</p>
<p>There are various types of essays, and the body part of the piece dramatically varies depending on the kind of essay you want for your items. Some of the types of articles we have included the argumentative essay, which is usually a common question, and the amount of time and resources that you want for the item asked.</p>
<h2><strong> Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The conclusion usually comes as the last part of the essay, and it usually contains a summary of the action points you want to achieve in the article and how they have produced.. However, the conclusion of the essay greatly varies with the type of essay you wish to write to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>References </strong></h2>
<p>Reference wrote in the last part of the essay you are writing. There are different ways of referencing the articles you have. Some of the styles we use in referencing are<a href="https://pitt.libguides.com/citationhelp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> MLA APA and CHICAGO</a> for your writing. Currently, references are paramount for any academic research paper you are doing and hence will help you achieve more grades in your academic homework help. Simply recommendations help to acknowledge the writer of the book and the work he or she has done in the research analysis of various items in the world. The main way that should</p>
<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>The outline is an essential part of literary analysis. So basically, what is an abstract? An abstract is simply a summary of the intentions in the articles that you are writing in your essay. The best abstract written when you complete writing your literature paper. The abstract is because it is the best part where you can be in a position to identify the problems that were solved by the methodologies and other pieces of the paper. To write the best abstract, you are always advised to ensure that you first complete the article you are writing so that you can be in a position to write the best summary of the questions in the forum. The amount of wording in an abstract is usually from 150 words to 250 words. The abstract part of the paper should never be too long, and it is one of the most crucial elements that makes part of academic writing. An abstract is essential in ensuring that you can organize your thoughts in a well-mannered way. Every proposal or research paper should always contain an abstract for the best project in your essay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>EXPERTS ADVICE: How <span style="color: #993300;">should</span> an academic essay be arranged?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"> There is a standard way of writing your academic papers or literature analysis before you submit it to your lecturer or supervisor. However, the arrangement of your academic essay is determined by the type of essay you are writing. On your paper, since every piece has its style, it is supposed to be written in, and hence one should follow the best example of the article you are writing about in your plot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Cover page.</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The first part that should in any academic essay is the <a href="https://www.easybib.com/guides/forums/topic/q-information-include-cover-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cover page.</a> Usually, the cover page is highly dependant on the type of essay you are writing and the instructions your instructor gives you. The most common factors found in a typical essay cover page include the;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1.Student Name: </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">This refers to the name of the student who is undertaking the essay. In a majority of articles, the student name starts with the surname followed rest names of the student.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2.Supervisor name:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The second part of the cover page is usually the supervisor name. The supervisor is the person in charge of your paper which a majority of the time is often your lecturer who assigned you the article in question</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3.Topic:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"> The third part of an academic essay is usually the topic. The problem is like a one-sentence summary of what you are doing in the paper. Every word in a question should come except the conjunctions in a sentence.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4.Date of submission: </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The submission date is usually the deadline or the time you are supposed to submit your essay to the lecturer. The date of the presentation should, in a way, the lecturer or the supervisor of your paper sees it best.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The cover page can also outline other elements; however, this highly depends on the school or the institution you are. Simply the cover page elements are not only fixed to the details talked above; they contain more parts or lesser depending on the course work you are doing for your studies. The cover page should always be centred and should not provide any other information except descriptive information like the one mentioned above in my article.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Running head.</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/11/running-head-format-for-apa-style-papers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/11/running-head-format-for-apa-style-papers.html</a>The running head always appears at the header part of any academic paper. It usually contains the topic as its central part. The running head is generally provided at all the pages of the academic paper that you are writing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Introduction </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The introduction part of any essay is usually essential. The introduction part of any piece should always be around 25% of the article. The introductory part should always be a summary of the whole academic essay in question. Like any other part of an essay, the first part of the article should also contain quality reference points.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Body </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The other essential part of an essay is the body part. This part contains all the details asked in the questions in the article. A majority of the references in the body part of the essay are quality references. The body part should always try to answer all the questions that I have asked. The body can run from one page to several pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The body part of the essay should contain various subheadings and headings you should always ensure that you arrange your paper in logical sections that part by part explains the subject in question. The body part of your essay should contain all the citations and attempt to understand the role of all the requirements of the problem in place. To achieve higher success in your academic papers, you should always ensure that you do proper research of all the information you have in your documents and dig deeper to come out with beautiful pieces of all the papers you have in your essay. In the body part of your article, you should have all the requirements set out in the topic. The body of your essay dramatically varies with the type of essay you are writing. If your article is explanatory, the body part of your essay should be different from if your essay is in an argumentative form.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">
<h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">The conclusion of your essay contains the references and the bibliography of your essay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;">
