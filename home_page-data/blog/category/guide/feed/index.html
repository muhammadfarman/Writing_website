										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is the second-largest money transfer fintech company globally after Western Union. It offers a long and well-established record of services. Most people and experts would solidly recommend using MoneyGram any time and any day because of its comprehensive services.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company offers cheap rates for certain currencies and a well and long-established record of service and extensive coverage.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What are its fees and Exchange rates?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here&#8217;s the dropdown;</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exchange Rate Margins:</span></em></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is known to apply the standard practice of taking a margin on the exchange rate. This means that the exchange rate offered to MoneyGram customers isn&#8217;t as good as the actual mid-market exchange rate. And MoneyGram profits from such a difference. Which is known as the exchange rate margin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram&#8217;s fees and exchange rates leave the service as the cheapest provider between countries. And according to analysis, MoneyGram was said to be the cheapest provider. That is, it took 1% of online searches across over half a million searches about sending and receiving money in Africa in September 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let&#8217;s use an example to make this discussion a bit simple for you. If you were in Los Angeles in the United States, and you desired to send about 1000 dollars to Beijing in China. You would have to pay about 58 dollars in total fees. And your beneficiary would receive about $942 if you decided to send via WorldRemit.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now, suppose you decided to still make the same transfer with MoneyGram, on the other hand. In that case, you&#8217;d pay a considerably high total fee of 78 dollars. And your beneficiary would be receiving $922. That&#8217;s more than a thousand yuan fewer than they&#8217;d receive if you&#8217;d sent with WorldRemit.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base Fees:</span></em></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MoneyGram fees vary, and that depends on the amount sent. Also, it depends on the transfer and receiving countries, and the payment and receiving methods. Here&#8217;s how you can save on fees with MoneyGram;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sending to a bank account is usually less expensive than sending money for cash pick-up.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;re sending money for cash-pickup, the online service will generally be cheaper than sending money at an agent location, and only if you make payments by bank transfer.</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When transferring in any kind online with MoneyGram, it would be best to pay by bank transfer if this would be available.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;re sending money to a bank account, it&#8217;s often more affordable to send at an agent location than online, and that&#8217;s regardless of the payment technique used. Still, the agent location fees can also vary a bit, and that&#8217;s depending on which location you do select.</span></li>
</ol>
