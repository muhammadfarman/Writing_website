										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, there have been growing concerns about Erectile Dysfunction in young men. Lots of people have had one thing or more to say about it. Some have talked about how dysfunction negatively impacts their lives or people close to them. Thus prompting the thoughts of whether or not this dysfunction is a thing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ED is expected to happen in more men who are more advanced innate than their younger counterparts. But then, medical statistics have proven that quite a lot of young men in their prime report problems about erectile dysfunction. And this situation has left us wondering why such is the case.</p>
<p>The research of ED in men uses an age-bracket of 40 for determining the cut-off point for the term “young.” This arbitrarily constructs that the male folks within the teenage age of 18-40 are considered young. Unless otherwise specified, we&#8217;ll be referring to them as such from this article henceforth.</p>
<h2>How Common Do Young Men Experience Erectile Dysfunction?</h2>
<p>As opposed to initial medical studies from the World Health Organization journal on Erectile dysfunction in young men. The number of affected persons has drastically risen than it used to be. Reports show that more than 26% of men who undertake ED treatment are below 40 years of age.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/dealing-and-avoiding-kidney-stones/">Dealing and Avoiding Kidney Stones</a></h2>
<p>From every indication, this picture is quite worrisome. This is telling us that more than we expect. It means that the number of affected young men suffering from ED is on the rise.  And there’s a need for us to deal with this problem before it eats deeper than it has already done. How do we go about this? We&#8217;d discuss that soon enough. But first, we have to deal with the factors that relate to ED in younger men.</p>
<h2>Causes of Erectile Dysfunction in Younger Men</h2>
<p>According to extensive researches carried out about young people with erectile dysfunction. There are lots of suggestions indicating that the same factors resulting in ED in older can constitute the same problem for the younger ones. Some considered examples include depression, anxiety, partner-related emotions, and lack of sexual stimuli or attraction toward the opposite sex. These are liable to cause psychological imbalance. It can result in dysfunction while physical symptoms related to hormones, cardiovascular, and metabolic functioning can also result in a more incremental, adverse impact for any man, irrespective of the age.</p>
<p>Let’s go into details. Outlined below are some of the factors that could lead to ED in younger men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Physical Factors</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is one factor we just can not do without mentioning first.  What we eat, drink and generally ingest have the potentials to make or mar us. So then, it isn’t a surprise this is taking the lead in our list of factors leading to ED in young men.</p>
<p>In a bid to explore how consumables cause ED in younger men, medical authors of Sexual Medicine journals revealed that a good number of men with ED were the ones that weren’t wary of the food and things they ingest. The study proved that young men that partied in taking unhealthy foods and drinks which includes alcohol and cigarettes are at the risk of getting ED than their counterparts that ate healthy consumables.</p>
<p>Other physical factors worthy of consideration include lack of adequate exercise, stress, and lack of personal hygiene. Most men who don’t participate in taking exercises frequently, or are overly stressed out after work or any activity are more likely to have ED owing that they don’t have the physical fortitude to maintain an erection. Also, poor personal hygiene from either the person involved or their partners can negatively influence the sexual life of younger men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Psychological Factors</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next part we&#8217;d be discussing is the mental causes of ED in younger men. Usually, this factor isn’t always considered owing that the patients involved didn’t take full consideration of it.</p>
<p>The truth is, once the psychological balance over sex isn’t properly regulated, the grit to perform sexually is depleted to minimal. Simply put, a depressed, overly anxious man will underperform sexually.</p>
<p>Although this researches might be kind of spontaneous, there’s a strong medical suggestion that young men&#8217;s intuitions of their genitals and how to manage sexual psychology can help foster sexual performance. This can positively impact ED in younger men than ever before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone suddenly falls on the floor, his breath is palpitating quickly, your guess the person is trying to catch his breath by all means. What would you do at this moment? Would you scream for help or would you just stand there numb? Perhaps you have no idea what to do. Well if you see such, anytime and any day then you’ve just seen someone who is having a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Here are the signs, especially if you suspect a loved one of yours;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unable to respond</strong>: The person is unable to respond even if you tap him or her so hard on the shoulders. Or if you scream his name, he’s unable to hear you. There’s absolutely no reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Increased palpitation</strong>: the person is either breathing fast, gasping for air, or not breathing at all; then here is time to act.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Act Quickly as it might be a cardiac arrest</h2>
<p>If you have tried all means physically, like; slapping, hitting and yelling the person’s name and he or she refuses to respond. Then there is a great tendency he or she is suffering from a cardiac arrest. Here’s what to do at such a moment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If people are around you or you’ve got neighbors, please scream for help immediately</strong>: Tell someone nearby to call the emergency care line and ask a person or another to bring an AED (automated external defibrillator), and that’s if there’s any presently. Everyone around you, especially YOU would need to be quick in response because time is of the essence at this moment. And if you’re alone and suspect the person you’re with has signs of cardiac arrest, then you’ll have to call the emergency care unit at once and get an AED if you have one at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-physical-therapy/">What you need to know about physical therapy</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observe rhythmic breathing</strong>: if the person is either gasping or not breathing at all, then administer a CPR quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Use an AED NOW:</strong> use this device as soon as it arrives. Turn it on and follow the instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Give a quick CPR</strong>: place your palm above each other (make sure both palms are together in the form of a fist) on his or her chest and push down at least 2 inches at a rate of 101 to 121 pushes a minute or two. Make sure is in the center of the chest and allow the chest to come back to its normal position after each soft press.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t give up, PLEASE</strong>: Continue with the CPR, until you see the person either move or breathe again or until a person with more advanced knowledge or training takes over from you, for example, an emergency response team member or EMS team member.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Here’s why you should learn CPR</h2>
<p>There is a high call for people to learn CPR, and that’s because the survival rates for victims with cardiac arrest is still worryingly low.</p>
<p>It is estimated that less than one in ten people survive a cardiac arrest, this is a shock to all medical personnel. You may want to ask why? Here’s why, the solution to this surprisingly sudden problem, is at the same time surprisingly easy. And that’s simply applying a simple CPR on the victim.</p>
<p>Every minute that passes by without the application of CPR can reduce the victim’s chance of ever surviving a cardiac arrest by around 10%.</p>
<p>So in essence, if CPR is taught to people, it could help save hundreds, even thousands of lives annually.</p>
<p>“We wish all young men and women feel confident and willing to help when faced with a first aid emergency, “said Joe Mulligan, head of first aid education at the British Red Cross.</p>
<h2>Learning First Aid treatment of Cardiac Arrest</h2>
<p>First of all, you have to know that learning first aid definitely helps to increase a person’s confidence, and we believe it’s a life skill and a necessity that everyone should have or apply.</p>
<p>Now it comes down to you the reader, you should have the opportunity to learn first aid throughout your life, if fortunately, beginning from your school, so that generations of people can be equipped with the skill or training they need to help when there is a need for a quick response or in an emergency.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of free teaching resources on paper and online, not to forget workshops; if you wish to make it practical. Most of these workshops are designed to give young people the confidence, willingness, and the skill to act in times of emergency.</p>
<p>According to Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director for NHS, England. He said, “When one in five people witness someone fainting and who clearly needs CPR. The majority of people have no idea what to do at such a moment.”</p>
<p>This shows that teaching CPR to school children equips them with the needed knowledge, that’ll help them to act in times of need. It breeds confident youngsters in the society, also allowing them to be the hero for the moment. And that can be thrilling to them.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>To sum it all up, there needs to be mandatory training for all young and old people. Mostly, in the skill of administering CPR to victims of cardiac arrest. This surely would improve the rate of survival.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows how dangerous an asthma attack is. It is as dangerous as death itself. To combat this, most asthmatics rely on inhalers as the medication for managing their symptoms when they are under attack. So far, it has proven to be extensively effective.</p>
<p>For healthy reasons, asthmatic patients have had a cause to always keep their inhaler within reach. But then, they are humans as well and are prone to have situations when the inhaler isn’t within grasp.</p>
<p>During this moment, it can be quite hazardous for the patient to manage through if the attack hits in. They&#8217;d find it extremely distressing to control and if not properly handled, it can result in more complex complications.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some nonmedical means to help regulate breathing until the patient is able to access their medication. How? We&#8217;ll be discussing that in this article.</p>
<p>First off, it’d be great if we started off with explaining what asthma means.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Asthma?</strong></h2>
<p>Asthma is a health condition whereby the airway is thinned, swell and produce extra mucus. Once it hits, breathing becomes more difficult, coughing is triggered as well as wheezing and breath shortness.</p>
<p>Asthmatic attacks don’t just happen. They are usually triggered by varieties of things which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroach Waste</li>
<li>Dust</li>
<li>Indoor and outdoor mold</li>
<li>Pollen,</li>
<li>Pet dander.</li>
<li>Weather change – Quite interesting, weather changes can cause asthmatic attacks.</li>
<li>Air pollution: Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, smoke, paint fumes, and diesel particles as well as other cleaning products have the capacity to trigger asthma.</li>
<li>Tobacco smoke.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/what-we-should-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/">What we should know about the new coronavirus</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Stress and Anxiety</li>
<li>Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have the capacity to trigger 5% of adult asthma patients.</li>
<li>Yelling, Laughing, Crying, Exercises and other activities that affect breathing can trigger asthma.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Managing Asthmatic Conditions</strong></h2>
<p>As aforementioned, there are some simple non-pharmaceutical tricks to manage asthma.</p>
<p>However, in the case that you experience any of the following symptoms, you’d do well by seeking emergency medical assistance as swiftly as you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty in breathing properly or stopped breathing.</li>
<li>Rapid pulse</li>
<li>Severe Anxiety</li>
<li>Bluish color to the lips and face, called cyanosis</li>
<li>Sweating profusely.</li>
<li>Reduced level of consciousness, such as somnolence or confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to deal with a mild asthmatic attack without an inhaler </strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Sit Upright</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you don’t have any business lying down or hunching over. Else, you risk having a restricted flow of air from and to your lungs. Rather, sit uprightly with your back straight. This way, your lungs will be kept open and more amount of air can flow through your respiratory systems.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Take Quick, Deep Breaths</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When under attack, your heart rate tends to be marginally unbalanced and this isn’t good for you. So, take in breaths to help control your heartbeat and free off any tension you have in your chest. Sit upwards and inhale deep, belly breaths through your nose and exhale through it through your mouth.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Remain as calm as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an asthmatic patient, you have to do away with every form of stress and anxiety as it tends to trigger or even worsen asthmatic attacks. Stay composed by taking deep breaths, and visualize what your next action should be.  You stand a better chance if you have someone with you to comfort you to be at peace. This would help bring down the attack.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Keep your nutrients around </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Having certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C and magnesium, is a good way of managing asthma symptoms. Due to the bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects of magnesium, medical practitioners encourage it to be used as adjuvant therapy for child asthmatics. Some medical studies even claim that adequate usage of vitamin C has the capacity to drastically reduce exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Avoid Asthma Triggers as much as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, you already know this but then, you might be able to control this when you’re under attack. Try everything your capacity to get away from possible triggers without you having to over-exert yourself. Be open to asking for help if you’re unable to get it done by yourself.  Try as much as you can and get to a  more filtered, temperature-controlled air and shade area.</p>

<h3><strong> Coffee is good</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Medical practitioners have over the years discovered that caffeine has the capacity to modestly improve airways function as much as four hours. This also offers to people without asthma. Actually, Caffeine metabolizes into theophylline that aids in dealing with and preventing asthma while relaxing the airway. Be careful with this as it does have the potential of speeding up your heart rate which can result in hyperventilating.  A cup or two is enough to keep you stable. Read more about it <a href="https://www.drugs.com/cg/hyperventilation-discharge-care.html">here</a></p>
<h3><strong>Bottom line</strong></h3>
<p>Asthma can be life-threatening especially when it has done beyond being mild to more severe symptoms. Hence, it is advisable that you keep your inhaler with you always. Also, you’d have to be around friends and people that understand your health condition so that they can help rejuvenate you when you pass out, have breathing problems or begin to hyperventilate. Remember, you might not be able to do each of these things yourself, you need people to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to extensive health research from the World Health Organization, (WHO) more than 10% of the total global population risk having kidney stones over the course of a lifetime. In recent times, the risk percent seem to have grown massively.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are serious misconceptions as to the causes of kidney stones even amongst elites. To deal with this, this article outlines the major causes and prevention of kidney stones.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-stones%23risk-factors&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8z5W2iq3nAhVLi1wKHaDDBLoQpYkCKAEwDnoECA0QCA&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wNYnpdEL21K9HcAyBbMkV">here</a> to learn more about the risk factors of kidney stones and how to avoid them.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Causes of Kidney stones and solutions</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Sweat Carefully</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Exercises are healthy for health. They help to stay fit and agile for other activities. But then, they have the potential of resulting in kidney stones. How’s this possible? Actually, when you sweat, you lose a lot of water either through the summer heat or exercise thereby causing you to urinate less than normal. The more sweat you produce, the less urine you produce, thus allowing stone causing materials to remain in the body system and bond to the urinary tract and the kidney.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/why-fiber-is-essential-for-a-healthy-diet/">Why Fiber is Essential for a Healthy Diet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution: </strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drink enough water. One of the most potent days of dealing with replenishing excessive water loss through sweat is through water hydration. This way, you’ll get to urinate more frequently than when you don’t hydrate enough.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>The effects of oxalate-rich food</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of ingestible foods contain oxalates. Foods like peanuts, chocolate, rhubarb, beets, spinach as well as sweet potatoes are examples of food relatively rich in oxalates. Moderately eating these foods may be beneficial for people with calcium oxalate stones, the leading type of kidney stones. However, one major misconception is that the reduction of oxalate-rich foods will rescue the chance of calcium oxalate kidney stones. Theoretically, this might be correct but it isn’t from an overall health perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid oxalate kidney stones, make sure to eat oxalate-rich food alongside adequate calcium in every of your diet. This way, both calcium, and oxalate can bind together in the stomach and intestine before being processed to the kidney, hence giving a lower probability for kidney stones to be formed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Eat enough Calcium: </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the time when you see people talk about kidney stones, they often find a way to wrap it around calcium-rich food. They see it as the culprit in calcium-oxalate stones. But then, they are extremely wrong. Rather, a calcium-diet increases the risk of developing kidney stones.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to cut down on your intake of calcium. Rather, work towards reducing the sodium and oxalates in your diet. If you must eat oxalate-rich foods, make sure to pair it with calcium-rich food to reduce the effect of oxalates on the internal organs.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>One Kidney stone influences getting another</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A kidney stone experience is one heck of a painful one. You don’t get it once and for all. Rather you stand the risk of getting more. While a lot of people will do everything they can not to have it again, it is almost impossible for it not to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Act now! If you dont utilize the correct medication and take the right diet adjustment, you stand the risk of having the stones coming back, and this time it might even be worse and can result in more complex problems like kidney disease.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Kidney stones vary.</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from the common calcium oxalate times, another type of kidney stone is the uric acid stones. Usually, this type of stone can be gotten from red meat, organ meats, and shellfish owning to their natural chemical compound known as purines. The intake of purine in large quantities can result in higher production of uric acid which can lead to a larger acid load for the kidneys to purge out. The higher the excretion of uric acid, the lower the alkaline level of the overall urine, this making the urine more acidic. A more concentrated acidic urine is a major opening for uric acid stones to form easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other to prevent the formation of uric acid stones, it is important that you reduce the intake of food high on purine. The likes of organ meat, shellfish, and red meat should be cut down drastically. Thereafter, you’d have to choose more vegetative eating and eat more healthily.  Your diet should contain more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, as well as low-fat dairy products. More importantly, you have to cut down on how you drink sugar-sweetened foods and drinks, especially the ones with a high level of fructose corn syrup. As expected, you’d have to do away with alcoholic beverages and drinks as it has the potential of increasing the uric acid levels in the blood and avoid crash diets for the same reason. Disciplining against eating less animal-based protein and ingesting more fruits vegetables and fruits increases your chance of reducing stone formation while decreasing the acidity in the urine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, cleanses and detox diets have grown to become trendy among people seeking to lead a healthy lifestyle. Actually it does point out to rid the body off toxins materials.</p>
<p>More importantly, detoxes don’t base solely on a toxin-ridding protocol, instead, it has included a kind of strategy to reset meals and filter it to less junk and more nutrient. But then, there have been speculative claims that detox and cleanses offers are sham and all a hype from what it actually promises.</p>
<p>How true is this claim?</p>
<p>Well, in as much detox are meant to put you in the habit of healthy eating, it does come with its own residual effect which can be avoided if you maintain proper protocols and eat balanced diets. But rather than delve into the residual side effects of detoxes and cleanses, let’s delve into what they actually promise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>What Does Detox Promise?</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, detoxes are there to rid your body of every harmful substance. Sometimes, they concern with a particular part in the body like the liver, kidney or lungs. All in all, detoxification helps you feel better.</p>
<p>To actualize this, cleanses (or detoxes as you might choose to refer them as) makes it compulsory to make sure that you don’t get to eat some specific kinds of food or drink some kind of juice. According to cleanses, these junk and unhealthy drinks are poisonous and are liable to pollute the body. More than just food intake, detoxes aims at making sure that the body ride of excessive addiction, drugs inclusive.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid-hype-or-hope/">Hyaluronic Acid – Hype or Hope?</a></h2>
<p>Presently, there are more than enough cleanses available in the market today that you may end up being confused if you don’t have a specific one in mind to purchase. But whichever one you buy, make sure it has the capacity to adequately cleanse the body system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>What happens when you detox your body? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, we understand the importance of vegetables and fruits to our body system. Hence, ingesting an adequate amount of these two, taking a good amount of detoxifiers and following a particular feeding logic will leave you super healthy.</p>
<p>But then, you can’t combine to live on that forever, else, you risk having excessive loss of weight.</p>
<p>Actually, water is saved up in your muscles with glycogen. So when you continue to eat a diet low in calories for a long time, it will prompt your body to use up glycogen stores easily and get to lose water weight alongside it. Hence, it is very important that you eat the appropriate proportion of food nutrients while on detox. This would enable you to gain back other vital nutrients such as fat, fiber, and protein.</p>
<p>Highlighted below are some of the underlying benefits of detox diets.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Weight Loss and Management</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One major goal of taking detox diets is the loss of weight.  In fact, it might be a very good morality to jumpstart your progress. Interestingly, you can as well inculcate it in your long-term weight management. With proper detox, you sure will be able to keep your body shape in check.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Increased Energy</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nobody likes to get fatigued for a long time. It’s always a good thing to be able to get through your daily activities and balance it with work and pleasure. Detox diets help you achieve just that.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Internal Organs</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the primary reason of taking detox is to purify your body system, you can be sure that your organs would be overly affected by the outcome. Hence, you can be sure that the internal organs will rid off excess waste and make your body system as great as new. This way, you can be sure to function optimally.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Functional Immune System</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since the primary function of the detox is to relieve your organs from excess workload, your immune system can do a better job to protect your body from external bodies and illness. In this case, your body will be able to absorb rich nutrients faster.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Improved thinking</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are unable to get a clearer, straightforward and solid memory and would want to do something to enhance it,  detoxing is your best option.</p>
<p>From this, we can deduce that the benefits of detoxing aren’t just physical importance. In fact, it aims at taking care of the psychological part of the human body as well. For optimal results, you can get to include meditation into your detox plan. Yes, it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Importantly, sugar crashes and other adverse effects of a toxic diet has the potential to affect your mind. However, if you’re able to explore the detox aspect benefit, it would be almost impossible to go back to an unhealthy lifestyle.  In case you’d want to read more about the benefits of detoxification, you can read it up <a href="https://classifieds.usatoday.com/blog/business/10-important-benefits-detoxing-body/">here</a>.</p>
<p>With the proper detoxing process, you’d be able to gather enough muscle tissue and not continue to run on fumes as most detox counter-studies suggest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, technology is making healthcare more accessible and affordable to the mass. So far, scientists have come up with technologies that can help humans attain good health. From genomics to 3D bioprinting, etc. The innovation continues.</p>
<p>Through these technologies, scientists have discovered various ways that help humans live longer, more productive, and healthier lives.</p>
<p>Even with all these been said, less has been talked about on ways these health technologies have influenced the healthcare industry. Again, it is important to discuss how these technologies will be more accessible to locations having challenges in accessing adequate healthcare.</p>
<p>The digital health industry recently provides few insights into the various changes it has on healthcare. Below are ways of how technology is currently making healthcare more accessible to the masses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Ways Technology Is Making Healthcare More Accessible And Affordable</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Remote visits by doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a fact that people living in rural areas lack easy access to quality and adequate healthcare. According to recent statistics, about 10% of the doctors living in the US are available in rural areas, posing a serious problem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>Now, telemedicine was innovated to solve these major challenges. It does this by providing a system of various remote medical consultations. With this development, patients can always speak with a healthcare provider by means of electronic &#8211; often phone or video.</p>
<p>Today, this field is growing strongly. It&#8217;s currently been used by more than a million people. These services seem to be a lot cheaper than the in-person system of doctor visits. It means individuals with low income can afford to speak with doctors. Today, millions of Americans are currently lacking health insurance.</p>
<p>Although the services rendered via telemedicine cannot treat all ailments. They are an effective and flourishing alternative to the need for frequent doctor visits. It only requires the assessment of symptoms and some prescriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Artificial intelligence doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is truly changing how many things are done. That is even in the healthcare industry. Although, some people may feel reluctant to consult with an AI doctor. Even if this is the case, this type of technology can still be more reputable than it could be imagined.</p>
<p>Just recently, artificial intelligence defeated some human doctors in a clinical exam. The British firm Babylon and other companies are striving to develop some applications that could help users obtain medical advice. This is from the comfort of their mobile devices.</p>
<p>AI technology is also capable of learning over a long period of time while building more experience. This will help people to have access to medical advice easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>The use of remote monitoring</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the help of health technology,  healthcare providers now find it easier to monitor the health status of their patients remotely. This now eliminates the need for patients to always visit their doctors face-to-face for follow-ups.  That is after which the treatment of a particular condition.</p>
<p>Today, there are different sorts of technologies that enable this to be possible. Some of the well-known applications are used for uploading information like blood sugar readings to healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Also, patients could wear devices that measure and give instant records. Most are wireless devices for transmitting information needed by the medical team. Home monitoring devices can also be used by senior citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Use of some personal health applications</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many personal apps have been created in many industries for health. This has also solved some problems. Today, lots of personal health apps can be found in the marketplace. They are mainly built for the purpose of helping people organize certain medical information.</p>
<p>With them, consumers can easily store important personal health information. There are many useful things these digital health tools can be used for. Combining different health apps can almost serve one as a personal doctor.</p>
<p>This health technology helps consumers take personal health into their hands. They offer 24/7 access to different medical pieces of information that are useful in making decisions when a doctor isn&#8217;t available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>E-consultation for doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As many of the medical specialists practice in urban areas, those residing in rural areas must travel long distances for serious health issues. For one, it is time-consuming and quite expensive. The innovation of some electronic consultations has solved this problem, to an extent. Now, there are tools for video conferencing which are used by primary care physicians located in rural areas. This allows them to virtually speak with those specialists.</p>
<p>With a tool like this, the physicians will gain the required knowledge for helping their patients. This means the patient doesn&#8217;t need to travel to visit a specialist.</p>
<p>As modern technology continues to be useful in many areas of healthcare, uninsured individuals, low-income earners, and people residing in rural areas will be getting more access to the quality healthcare they deserve.</p>
<p>Here is how health technologies are reducing <a href="https://tincture.io/healthcare-technologies-reducing-risk-increasing-access-fded547517e0?gi=a35624840093">dangerous health risks</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, there have been global growing anxieties about the new, widespread coronavirus. According to global reports, the number of infected patients has increasingly risen and there are other suggestive reports of other isolated places across the world, owing to international travels.</p>
<p>This deadly disease was discovered in Wuhan, a sub-city in China in 2019. Since then, over 1300 cases of the diseases have been reported, and not less than 40 deaths recorded.</p>
<p>However, the government of many countries has charged their public health officials to put measures in place to efficiently put a stop of the virus. In a bid to justify this move, there have been temporary travel restrictions to and from Wuhan, China. In more mild cases of emergency travels, strict health screening measures have been put in place to curtail the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>However, with the ever-evolving information and news about this deadly virus, it wouldn’t be out of place if you’re worried. You’re concerned as to what to do, and what not to do. How do you avoid it? Can it be treated? These and many other questions are what are plaguing your thoughts.</p>
<p>Anyways, we’ve done justice to your worries. In this article, we have highlighted notable information to enable you to gain more insight into the virus. Take your time to read through and you can be sure to stay safe. For more history and information about the coronavirus, read <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">here</a> or wait for subsequent posts about it on this platform.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a coronavirus?</strong></h2>
<p>Actually, there is no specific clarity about what  coronaviruses are. However, some medical experts choose to explain it as an awfully widespread cause of colds as well as upper respiratory infections. Usually, these viruses are zoonoses, meaning that they have the capacity to spread from certain animals to another, and in more severe cases, spread to humans especially if there are occurrence changes in the virus.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the health authorities in China received lots of reported groups of pneumonia sicknesses in late December 2019. Further researches exposed that most of the sick people had come in contact with the animal and seafood market in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has been a major transfer from one person to the other, thereby resulting in an alarming widespread.</p>
<h2><strong>Symptoms of Coronavirus</strong></h2>
<p>The symptoms of the coronavirus vary. It could include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Possible fever</li>
</ul>
<p>In more severe cases, the likes of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting happen.</p>
<p>If discovered earlier, it can be treated and the patient recovers within a short while. However, the same can not be said for the elderly, very young ones or people with a weakened immune system. They can result in more serious complications such as pneumonia, and bronchitis.</p>
<h2><strong>Can the coronavirus be treated?  </strong></h2>
<p>As of now, there are no remedial solutions for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, scientists are working hand in hand with the global government, especially with the Chinese public health authorities to get a cure for the coronavirus. For critical cases, the patients are moved to specialized, aggressive care, in an intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Here is a list of countries where the coronavirus has been discovered.  If you can, avoid unnecessary visits to these countries and even if you must, make sure that you are properly sanitized and treated prior and after your visit.</p>
<ul>
<li>China</li>
<li>United States</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>South Korea</li>
<li>Taiwan</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Thailand</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Nepal</li>
<li>Vietnam</li>
<li>Hong Kong</li>
<li>Macau</li>
<li>Malaysia</li>
<li>Canada</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not uncommon to hear people talking about the ingredients contained in a beauty or skincare product. In fact, it is the basis with which most people purchase their products. However, with the like of hyaluronic acid (HA) hitting the shelves more recently with lots of skincare products, it has left us wondering whether or not to see it as the hope or it is just a heaped hype.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is HA? Does it offer any major benefits and are there any effective ways it can be applied than the normal application?</p>
<h2><strong>Explaining hyaluronic acid! </strong></h2>
<p>Actually, hyaluronic acid is a humectant. A kind of substance capable of retaining moisture and coercing it with more weight in liquid. Naturally, this substance can be found in every part of the human body. Actually, the kind of HA utilizes dome sort of bacteria to make beauty and skincare products by sourcing it via a process called bio-fermentation in the laboratory.</p>
<p>However, as we continue to grow older, these substances in our body, including hyaluronic acid continues to decrease, thereby causing our skin to lose plumpness, hydration, and adequate volume.</p>
<h2><strong>How much quality does Hyaluronic Acid produce tends to give our body? </strong></h2>
<p>From the look of things, most of these HA-induced products claim to increase the quality value of the skin. How true is this claim?</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/best-accounting-help/">Writing errands: For best accounting help.</a></h2>
<p>Well, we&#8217;ll have to take a deeper look into the type of HA available in the product. Usually, HA isn’t usually of the same molecular sizes. While some are broken down, some are excessively massive in size. Meanwhile, the latter can not penetrate into the skin easily despite being able to bind water and hydrate the body. So when such HA-product is applied to the skin, it had little or no effects on it. Only the topmost layer of the skin is overly influenced. However, the same cannot be said for products with a smaller quantity of molecules. These one’s plunge through and deeper into the skin with ease.</p>
<p>In some embodiments, Hyaluronic Acids serves as dermal fillers, which are usually composed of HA in an injectable gel form. HA fillers include volume by practically overlaying their placement area and drawing in water to improve the filling effect. Once it is perfectly done, manufacturers can make use of HA fillers to make products that influence a lot of ornamental concerns, such as cheeks lifting, skin softening, augmenting sunken, dark, undereye circles, hydrating and enriching the lips, as well as stimulating the hands and earlobes.</p>
<p>To read more about how manufacturers exploit hyaluronic acids for cosmetic purposes, take a deep dive and read more about it <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.manufacturingchemist.com/news/article_page/Hyaluronic_acid_the_biotech_way/41631&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn8d2FhajnAhWMi1wKHVY3Dp8QFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VnNGVZwyqjSjsh-2skQY0">here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Hyaluronic worthy of the hype or is it just a sham? </strong></h2>
<p>So, is it safe to conclude that HA is the answer to our different cosmetic problems or is it just a hype from a selected public to sell products? To answer this, we must first establish the fact that topical HA is not as effective or strong as injectable HA filler which is capable of refurbishing lost skin quality. Although some topical HA products are ignorantly paraded as topical “fillers.” Notwithstanding, Topical HA is a terrific moisturizer. Yet, on the off chance that the major goal is to improve volume loss and skin autonomy that naturally comes with aging and dryness. Injectable HA would be a better choice and a more effective method than topical HA.</p>
<p>Don’t get this wrong, Topical HA has got lots of positive attributes. It tolerates quite well and does not usually cause allergic reactions which might result in skin irritation. More importantly, it is a good choice for pregnant and lactating mothers&#8217; skin.</p>
<p>However, for individuals with dry skin, or those with dewier, moisturized skin feel cravings during the cooler periods, a moisturizer or serum-containing HA is a great choice to utilize. But then, you have to be constantly reminded that topical HA will only hydrate the surface level of your skin and not penetrate deeper within it.</p>
<h2><strong>Final verdict</strong></h2>
<p>There is a surrounding doubt about hyaluronic acid being the latest cosmetic ingredient trends. Virtually every skincare product you see available in the market today contains it. From anti-aging creams, serums, acne prevention washes, to mask, sunscreen and other products, you’ll definitely find them there.</p>
<p>However, just as it is with other accepted skincare ingredients, HA is only valuable when it is used rightly. Should you be at taking off the visibility of facial wrinkles or to moisturize your skin, a cosmetic product containing hyaluronic acid would be a good choice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the same cannot be said for those looking to prevent acne or patches of skin hyperpigmentation. Rather, it would be better you take a look at another direction. Else, you’d be wasting your resources on what isn’t going to work for you. While hyaluronic acid works well to clear off anti-aging wrinkles and dehydration, it cannot solve every skincare problem. So, make your choice wisely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, over a quarter of the total baby births stories in the United States of America, and the world at large experienced birth defect. While some are minor and do not require any major medical treatment, others are very complicated and might result in serious health complications and could require surgery to correct. Let&#8217;s talk about birth defects in children</p>
<h2><strong>But what exactly are birth defects in children? </strong></h2>
<p>Simply put, birth defects in children are health conditions that happen before or after childbirth.  It could either be psychological, physical, or medical.</p>
<p>A recent study deduced that there are over  4,000 types of birth defects in children, hence making it challenging to affirm what exactly is a birth defect to other health conditions. Highlighted below are some of child defects issues:</p>
<p>Down syndrome</p>
<p>Cleft lip or palate</p>
<p>Cerebral palsy</p>
<p>Congenital heart defects</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome</p>
<p>Spina bifida</p>
<p>Upper and lower limb reduction defects</p>
<p>Club foot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Causes of Birth Defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Medical-wise, there are lots of factors that could result in birth defects in children. To put it mildly, it could result from genetic problems, environment, ingestion or even personal behaviors. Generally, a detectable birth defect is usually environmental, which might be as a result of the pregnant mother&#8217;s exposure to chemicals or problems with the genre of the baby.</p>
<p>Notable medical researches have proven that the following conditions and activities can influence the chance of birth defects during pregnancy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking certain medications</li>
<li>Smoking or dealing in drugs</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Certain medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</li>
</ul>
<p>As aforementioned, these are only a few activities and conditions that could lead to childbirth defects. There could be more than a thousand and one other reasons out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Preventing birth defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are remedial steps that can be taken to curtail birth defects during pregnancy. Should it be followed strictly, there is every chance that the pregnant mother will give birth without any form of defects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Visiting competent health care providers</strong>:</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon discovering that you’re pregnant,  your next shot should be how to schedule your session with your health care provider. The potentials of staying healthier are more when you register for ante-natal care with competent health care practitioners. Whilst you’ve gotten attended to, you should take the time to talk about every activity, medication, and complications you might be having with your doctor. This way, your gynecologist can put you through the necessities that would preferably put you on the high.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Vaccination matters: </strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One important factor that you greatly consider when having your appointment with your doctor is vaccination. You cannot underemphasize the importance one bit. Being vaccinated against flu and other sicknesses would go a long way to make sure that your pregnancy is healthy and you have a safe childbirth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Dealing with pre-existing conditions</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to take care of pre-existing health conditions before getting pregnant. Don’t get this wrong. You do have the right to be pregnant whenever you want to so long as you have the all-round means to take care of a child. But then, you should consider the future of the child and not subject him/her to pains or discomfort. Even you, you deserve painless childbirth. Hence, you have to take care of any conditions that can hinder you from this happiness. A good example of problems you have to deal with is diabetes and obesity. These two have a high potential of badly affecting childbirth. Take every precaution you can so you can be on a high every time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Folic Acid is important</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under every circumstance, a pregnant woman should ingest 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Even so, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get prepared before the said time. With the constant taking of prenatal supplements and multivitamins, you should be able to get enough folic acid sustenance to last you for a while.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>A foreign substance is a no-no</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a pregnant woman, you don’t have any business engaging in smoking, taking hard drugs or alcohol. Aside from pregnancy, these habits are injurious to health. And since you have another “flexible” life in you to worry about, you really should do away with it totally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Family History and healthy living</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even without being told, healthy living is essential to living well. However, with pregnancy now in the picture, it can help deal with birth defects. Eating healthy and engaging in healthy activities would go a long way to making your baby healthy.</p>
<p>Also, in the case that your family has a history of defects during childbirth, then this is the right time to discuss it with your doctor.  Your gynecologist can refer you to a genetic counselor or therapist that will help determine the potential of your child being not with a defect or not.</p>
<p>However, even after prenatal testing and you know that your baby has the potential of being born with a defect, then you really shouldn’t be worried or be sick over it.  You’re not alone in this quest. There are laid down programs to support pregnant women with possible childbirth defects. Simply enroll in one and get familiar with what to expect until, when and after your baby arrives. You, your baby and family will appreciate you for that.</p>
