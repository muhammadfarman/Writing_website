										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can&#8217;t proceed with this without explaining what Bitsika means. <strong>Bitsika</strong> is simply a remittance platform that utilizes cryptocurrencies and fiat money to send or deliver quick money transfers. It sends or delivers in Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, and more African countries within a specific transaction threshold.</p>
<p>Bitsika was launched in 2019. So far, the company has managed to process one million dollars&#8217; transaction on its platform in less than three months.</p>
<h2>How to make instant money transfer using Bitsika;</h2>
<p>First of all, you have to know the supported money payments for this platform. They are; credit or debit cards, mobile money, Bitcoin, and bank transfer.</p>
<p>Also, you can send money to just anyone who has the Bitsika app in supported countries by simply using their username. And the process is somewhat instant, and you can send as little as one cent. And the recipient receives the money in less than about five minutes.</p>
<h2>The signing-up process;</h2>
<p>First of all, you need to use your Gmail account to sign up for the Bitsika app. And Google takes such responsibility to manage your password and ensure your overall safety.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you&#8217;ll also need to download the app onto your phone, tablet, or any mobile internet-enabled gadget in particular. With that done, you&#8217;ll be assigned a username. It starts with the dollar encoded sign— $Martin, $Catherine, $Kate, etc. The Bitsika app is available on the Apple Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>When you have your username, you&#8217;ll automatically have your account set up for you. There will be no further hassling procedures.</p>
<h2>Acting it</h2>
<p>$Martin in Nairobi desires to send money to $Kate in Cape Town. He makes a deposit of 200 dollars&#8217; credits on the Bitsika app through bank transfer or credit card. Then he proceeds by sending that 200 dollars to $Kate, all within the app. $Kate withdraws the money through mobile money. And the transaction is processed within three minutes in the maximum.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk about how you make a deposit using Bitsika;</h2>
<p>You can deposit cash on the application through various payment platforms such as debit cards or bank transfers. Each deposited amount is virtually exchanged into USDC currency, issued by Coinbase. It is preserved in the app as your balance. And, the good part about this is, the deposited amount never changes its value.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ll like to ask you this, do you know what USDC is?</h2>
<p>USDC is simply a stable coin backed by the United States currency or, simply put, US dollars. They are known to be held in reserve by regulated financial institutions. Regulated financial institutions also issue the tokens themselves. Also, every token can be redeemed for just 1$, and that&#8217;s providing a price-stable cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>How does $Kate make her withdrawal?</h2>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s simple. With Bitsika, you can decide to withdraw from the app to your bank account or another digital wallet such as mobile money.</p>
<p>And do you know that transferring money between countries happens with the help of crypto in the background? But you aren&#8217;t even aware of this, I guess? As they are fondly called, these USD credits are believed to be the best way the African market trader will access the USD without any form of hustle and toil. It&#8217;s also believed to be a great store of value for you. Yes, talking to you! and that&#8217;s if you want to hedge your assets from unstable currencies. Quite cheeky.</p>
<h2>This is what you’ll be expecting by making transactions with the Bitsika app;</h2>
<p>For just any transaction on Bitsika of up to three hundred dollars, there are no charges included! Neither does the service add a markup on the exchange rate. There&#8217;ll also be a small charge— just that small, and that&#8217;s after you cross the needed threshold.</p>
<p>In general, Bitsika is known to make its money from interest on fiat and crypto reserves. From such percentages, it charges on merchant API for businesses that desire to collect money from its users. It can be users from all over Africa and other parts of the world through Bitsika credits.</p>
<h2>Here are countries you can send or receive cash via Bitsika;</h2>
<p>As I said, at the moment, Bitsika permits its customers to send money to their friends and family in the following countries;</p>
<p>Mauritius, Gabon, Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana.</p>
<p>Here are the supported payment gateways;</p>
<p>Presently, the supported payment methods are Bank transfer (if you&#8217;re Nigerian), Mobile Money (Ghanaian), Bitcoin (worldwide), and Credit and Debit cards (worldwide).</p>
<p>Reasons on why you should use Bitsika apps to make transfers<strong>; </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Bitsika is known to be a multi-currency app. </em></li>
<li><em>You can also generate a virtual VISA card right on this app. Use it to pay on your favorite websites. For example, Netflix, Amazon, and everywhere virtual VISA card is accepted. </em></li>
<li><em>It does a KYC on you for security reasons; this means your transaction details are all safe. </em></li>
<li><em>You can also purchase airtime in Nigeria or Ghana— and that’s if you’re looking for the means to make a quick recharge. </em></li>
<li><em>Bitsika app is known to allow you to make money off the platform, and that&#8217;s by simply introducing and referring your friends. And you earn a 1-dollar referral for doing so. </em></li>
</ol>
<h2>What you can do with Bitsika;</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>It serves as a wallet. </em></li>
<li><em>As a form of social payment.</em></li>
<li><em>You can use it to create virtual cards. </em></li>
<li><em>Buy and sell BUSD. </em></li>
<li><em>Buy and sell bitcoin, etc. </em></li>
</ol>
<h2>Final Say</h2>
<p>Bitsika has entered and is seemingly penetrating Africa to reduce all costs of sending money, which is known to be the highest globally.</p>
<p>This fintech plans on becoming the leading money transfer in the continent, and that’s by simply using blockchain technology to save money and time in international money transfers.</p>
<p>In addition, it has also identified and solved the two major issues relating to Pan-African international transfers: rigorous and difficult modes of sending and receiving cash and pricing. The app also has the much-needed poise to spread to the rest of the continent in a short while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SHRM Versus HRM</strong></p>
<p>Organizations differ depending on their capabilities and resources. Regardless of the resources that a specific entity has, the concept of strategy plays a very essential role in company growth and expansion This is because it is through the strategy that organizations are capable of achieving sustainable or firm competitive advantage. The term strategy as applied in both corporate and human resource management goes beyond the aspect of competitive advantage. It, therefore, means specific, obtainable, and measurable plans that can be developed by company stakeholders. Here, these measurable plans could aim at linking the subordinates so that they can be in the position to achieve desired targets. Since the concept of strategy is wide, the research focuses on demonstrating its integration in human resource management.</p>
<p>Even though many people in societies confuse strategic human resource management (SHRM) with human resource management (HRM), the two phenomena are totally different. According to studies, SHRM refers to a management function that aligns human resource management practices, programmes, and polices with corporate strategies (Delery &amp; Roumpi, 2017). The core intention of this function is to ensure that organizations achieve their objectives without experiencing complexities. It does so by improving the entire business operations while maintaining organization culture. This culture can be associated with research, development, or innovation that could be of greater significance in enabling business enterprises to gain sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>There are various benefits that an organization can gain as a result of developing and implementing the managerial function of strategic human resource management. One of these benefits is related to job satisfaction. Just like customers in marketing management, employee needs and wants are catered by this management function. It is very hard for business operations to prosper when employees are not happy about remuneration and other employment benefits. SHRM exists to ensure that all issues related to employees are resolved towards maximum production. Therefore, employees will perform their responsibilities effectively since their satisfaction is of greater focus. Job and increased customer satisfaction are as a result of strategic human resource management. This means that customers and employees are valued as the cored resources that assist organizations in achieving maximum production.  Not only does SHRM is linked to organization production but also acts as an effective approach towards managing employees.</p>
<p>On the other side, human resource management (HRM) refers to the systematic way of managing employees or human resources. The article of <em>Fundamentals of Human Resource Management</em> also defines HRM is the practice that organizations develop and implements towards maximizing the manner at which employees perform (Noe et al., 2018). This is one of the strategies that business enterprises can adopt to become more productive and efficient. For instance, human resource management (HRM) has a wide variety of policies and principles that an entity can use in order to oversee the personnel. It is essential to demonstrate that this does not work in Isolation with organizational systems and policies. For this reason, HRM entails all the possible ways that can assist business enterprises in managing the skilled workforce.</p>
<p>There are several activities that are associated with the concept of human resource management (HRM).  Some of these human-oriented practices entail but are not limited to industrial relations, performance appraisal, recruiting, development and training, health as well as safety. If organizations can effectively consider these activities, then Stewart &amp; Brown (2019) argues that human resource practices and policies can be adjusted to facilitate corporate strategies. For organizations to adopt these effectively, there is a need for skilled manpower described as a human resource manager. This skilled professional is entitled to functions such as overseeing change, evaluation, managing employee relationships, monitoring, maintaining, developing, staffing, and planning.</p>
<p>Having clearly defined the meaning and importance of SHRM and HRM concepts, it is essential to highlight some of the key differences between the two. The core difference is based on the objective between SHRM and HRM. Strategic human resource management (SHRM) aims at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of employees towards enabling business enterprises to achieve their desired targets or goals. According to studies, some of the essential activities that can add value as long as SHRM is involved in organizational goals are employee retention, motivation, compensation, promotion, training, selection, and appraisal (Armstrong, 2016). On the other hand, HRM aims at employee compensation after an appropriate selection. This means that employees are entitled to employment benefits because of participating in organizational practices or operations.</p>
<p>Another difference between SHRM and HRM is related to governance and leadership. When it comes to strategic human resource management (SHRM), managers in all departments are coordinating employees and the operations they do. It is essential to demonstrate that this kind of governance is applicable to <em>all</em> managers who are involved in the daily operations of employees. These managers can be in strategic positions or any other department that is of greater significance in assisting the organizations in achieving organizational targets. In strategic HRM, the human resource manager acts as an imitator. This means that he or she is always seeking for the transformational category of leadership. On the other side of HRM, only the human resource department is responsible for employee coordination. When it comes to leadership, the human resource manager acts as a change follower. For this reason, he or she is capable of responding to changes through the transactional approach of leadership.</p>
<p>In addition, it becomes hard for the organization to prosper without appropriate strategies. Managers have to make vital decisions on matters regarding critical operations. The scope of decisions is another factor that can be used to differentiate strategic human resource management (SHRM) from human resource management (HRM). In SHRM, for instance, decisions related to the issues of employees are always proactive. Delery &amp; Roumpi, 2017) establishes that a proactive strategy of decision making allows human resource experts to anticipate core issues during employee training and staffing level. It is through effective anticipation that a human resource manager(s) can develop strategies for constant production. On the other side of HRM, decisions are reactive in nature. The reactive model, therefore, takes an immediate effect of responding to issues. This means that human resource issues are responded to as soon as they occur. If the organization experience low production as a result of poor employee training, for instance, then the human resource department utilizes its resources and efforts in developing effective solutions.</p>
<p>Organizations have different resources that are of greater significance when it comes to the attainment of goals. However, employees are termed as the core element that assists business enterprises in delivering their promises to customers. The manner at which employees are treated can be used as a dimension to demonstrate key differences between SHRM and HRM. Ideally, human resources are considered as a business partner in SHRM. Some studies believe argue that partnership does not only involve employers and employees but also as well (Bailey et al., 2018). Since human resources are perceived as internal customers in SHRM, they are handled with great care and respect. On the other side, the concept of human resource management considers human resources as &#8216;hired people or workers&#8217;. The consequences of this consideration are intense due to limited care and respect. Organizational performance seems to poor since there is no appropriate mechanism of motivation.</p>
<p>Just like the way the customer relationship management approach is used to maintain the relationships between customers and marketers, organizations may decide to adopt other approaches towards achieving sustainable performance and competitive advantage. However, the category of approach to be adopted depends on the type of concept implemented by the organization. For the managerial concept of SHRM to be successful, business enterprises ought to consider the integration approach. This approach aims at aligning the core business strategies with developed human resources practices for the organization. It is through effective alignment that corporate targets can be achieved without the organization facing challenges. On the other side of human resource management (HRM), business enterprises must follow the fragmentation approach. Here, the organization is forced to develop and implement management guidelines while overseeing human resources or employee.</p>
<p>In most cases, organizations fail in achieving corporate targets because of increased costs of operations. Not only does cost becomes the only factor that makes organizations lose their ambitions also a waste of resources and time. For instance, human resource managers waste a lot of time while supervising or controlling employees. The challenge of time wastage has been eliminated by the strategic human resource management function (SHRM). According to Armstrong (2016), it is through management guidelines or principles that human resource experts have eliminated the aspect of stringent control. The rationale behind the absence of stringent control is that rules associated with the management of manpower are lenient. While in human resource management (HRM), managers are exercise stringent control over the employees through supervision, monitoring, and other managerial activities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, organizations should always evaluate the capabilities and establish a strategic approach or function they develop and implement. If business enterprises agree to go with strategic human resource management (SHRM), then are several elements they should know. Such key elements entail a proactive style of decision making, integration approach, responsibility (departmental managers), employee treatment (business partner), no stringent control (management guidelines), and objective (efficiency and effectiveness of employees). On the other hand of human resource management (HRM), managers should consider critical elements like a reactive style of decision making, fragmentation approach, responsibility (human resource department), employee treatment (hired workers), presence of stringent control, and overall objective (employee compensation and selection).</p>

<h1><strong> COVID 19 IN EDUCATION SECTOR</strong></h1>
<p>coronavirus pandemic is a health crisis that  people are experiencing globally. It has posed a great challenge to the world as no cure has been found. This is due to its effects not only to the health sector but also to the socio-economic sectors. Most countries have decided and taken actions to alleviate the growth and development of a full-blown pandemic. Therefore countries have gone into localized closures. Schools, universities and all education systems have been closed down. As they can be a faster means of spreading the virus. This has resulted in home-schooling especially in countries that have been heavily affected. Countries such as Italy, Iran, and Korea. These changes in the education system have brought about inconveniences. However, innovation and invention within the sector get promption. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting influence on learning and its activities.</p>
<h3><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Growth in public-private educational partnerships</strong></a></h3>
<p>Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, there will be growth in public-private education partnerships. Different stakeholders within the education sector are on the lookout for solutions. In some countries, students engage in homeschooling. Where interactive applications is in use to enhance it. Others are using live television broadcasts. Where all learning materials are being made available. While in some, less innovative solutions are being implemented. Such as the use of Google Classroom where face to face instructions are given. All these solutions have assisted in keeping students busy while at home. Through the concept of digitization in education, learning anywhere, anytime might be the new trend in the education system.</p>
<p>The digital platforms that are being used are a result of combined efforts by learning coalitions and stakeholders. The stakeholders such as the government, education professionals, technology providers, and network providers. Through this education has received more attention. Going beyond the projects that are being funded by the government and non-profit social projects. Private organizations such as Microsoft and Google have developed a great interest and are investing in innovative education solutions. Both the private sector and government are arising to the authority of educated people. However, due to the pandemic, there is a limit on the carrying out of initiatives. However, it is evident that after the pandemic large-scale and cross-industry partnerships would be established. Involving the private and public sector with a common goal of providing education in the most convenient way.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Effects of the partnerships</strong></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/annual-report/mobilizing-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth of these partnerships has begun</a>. For example in China, the Ministry of Education has assembled diverse parties. Who have contributed to the development of a new cloud-based, online learning and broadcasting platform.  This has led also to the upgrading of the education infrastructure in China. Which has been led by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and other stakeholders. Also, in Hong Kong a readtogether platform has been developed. It is an association with over 60 education organizations, the media, professions in the entertainment industry, and publishers.  Through this platform, educational resources and materials are provided. Materials such as assessment tools, book chapters, videos, and free counseling services.  The association aims and making use and upholding the platform in the future even after the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The development of these partnerships will be a trend. This is especially in countries where the government has been predominantly providing education. However, policies and regulations will need to be put in place. They will contribute to the execution and implementation of common goals. This will provide a clear guideline of how the partnerships will work, the contribution of each party, how decisions will be made.  In these, a code of conduct is emphasizes, ways of handling and managing conflict and ways of reaching a consensus in the case of disagreements. This ensures equity and fairness for both the private and public sectors.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits to the education system </strong></h3>
<p>This will greatly boost the education system leading to an educated populace. Through this, some of the major issues get solution over time. Issues such as unemployment, poverty, and underdevelopment. Education equips the population with the required skills, knowledge, and expertise in different professions. Through which people can seek employment, create employment opportunities, and come up with inventions and innovations within different sectors. Thus a majority of a country&#8217;s population engage in economic activities.</p>
<p>That enable them to earn a living. Therefore leading to high standards of life and reduced levels of poverty. Innovations and inventions are a major source of attraction to foreign investors. Therefore, boosting the economy of countries. The partnerships within the education sector may prompt partnerships in other sectors. Sectors such as the health sector, hospitality, and food sector among others. This brings about unity, equity, cooperation and effective use of resources. As the different sectors of a country’s economy are focusing on common goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>In conclusion, The COVID 19 pandemic has brought about inconveniences. However it is also prompting changes whose effects will be of benefit. Therefore as we find temporary solutions  to the problems arising, it is also important to look into permanent solutions for some of these issues. The COVID 19 pandemic has brought about a change in different sectors. It is therefore a primary responsibility and obligation to the world population to swiftly adapt. Adapting to the new changes and develop mechanisms. Which encourage growth and development. Therefore development despite the effects of the pandemic.</p>

<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>While product marketing often falls under the jurisdiction of a marketing department team to engage customers to buy directly from the company, product management, on the other hand, covers every purview about the product’s entire cycle from its manufacturer to sale and even more to the final consumer. Click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/marketing-sales/marketing-promotion/marketing-basics/seven-ps-marketing&amp;ved=2ahUKEwisvrPV_rHnAhXRQkEAHdrkCHUQFjAMegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MIVjo8zSuA7AVNpz12Vzo&amp;cshid=1580617774561">here</a> if you’d like to have deeper, in-depth knowledge about the 7 P&#8217;s of product marketing strategy</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding the 7 P&#8217;s of Product Marketing Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Professional product marketers often refer to some precepts while dealing with business. These precepts are the basis on which strategies are built.  To the non-initiate, it is simply the “Seven Ps” of marketing, but to kick-ass marketers, it is the seven pillars of commerce.  Let’s delve deeper to see the reason behind this notion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Product</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin with, you cannot go into marketing without having a specific product or products in mind. Meanwhile, your products might span across different things depending on the kind of company you operate on.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the product, you’re into, you stand a better chance of leveraging your product by integrating the seven Ps for better sales. More importantly, you stand a better chance when you know the product you’re dealing with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next on our list of seven Ps is pricing. It is important to know that you just cannot fail to consider pricing when you already have your product. Even if you don’t have many competitions, you have to consider pricing in such a way that your customers are overly considered and they can be influenced overly to patronize you.</p>
<p>At this point, it is just more than setting a price tag on a product and expects your customers to pay. No, it goes way beyond that. This time, you have to overly consider whether or not the general market ecosystem satisfies with your product and the subsequent pricing. Here, you’ve got to answer wavering questions like &#8211; How much is my product overly in demand? How well does my pricing fit into my potential customers&#8217; budget? Do I have people selling the same products, if yes, what’s their pricing like? These and many other questions are the questions that should ravage through your mind as you set your pricing for your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Place</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the laymen, place refers solely to the location as far as product marketing is concerned, but then it goes way beyond that. Actually, they refer to the distribution strategy you have out in place to get your product across to your customers.  It refers to the channel put in place to make sure that once your product is already known, and your price set, you can get to your specific customers without any hassles. That way, you have them coming back to patronize your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every of the seven Ps in product marketing is important but then, we must pay close attention to the fourth P, Promotion.</p>
<p>More than just advertising, promotion goes deeper as to how your product is presented to the outside world. Does your product sit well in the mind of the consumers when it is been advertise? How much of a solid influence does your product have? How many customers seeing your ad are more willing to take the step to patronize you? These and many other questions are what make up your promotion. Although it is advertising, it is however basically on another level entirely. This time, it covers brand awareness, lead acquisition, demand generation, product differentiation as well as product messaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Process</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The product marketing process is the absoluteness that links the product marketing campaign to their major consumers. Simply put, the process in product marketing refers to the “conditions” put in place by the project team/ manager for customers to complete before getting a product.  This time around, it encompasses the other four Ps – the Product, Pricing, Place And Promotion. Hence, it makes way more easy to know who your real customers are and help you devise a method to keep them glued to you while you source for more patronage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>People</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, other Ps are useless without this P. Don’t get it all wrong. Other P&#8217;s are just as important as each other. but then, without people, then theirs is no market. You have this P happening straight from the production chain of delivery to the very last P of physical evidence. People are needed to make up the team that would deliver the product. You need people with quality and skills that can help make the product a success, even in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>Also, people are needed in distributing your product to the right consumers. People are needed to advertise your business. You need people to consume your product. In short, your product needs people to fully the right pricing. Of course, the sole reason your marketing team is working so hard is basically because of making sales. So, it is close to impossible to refuse not to be concerned about people when dealing with marketing. They are the bedrock to determine whether you’ll advance in the commerce spree or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Physical evidence</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find read the sixth P, about people, then you probably know we will be addressing “Physical Evidence” as our final P. This P is concerned with addressing every physical context that happens all through the course of your marketing. This includes every paraphernalia such as confirmation emails, PDF invoices, receipts, and even the “thanks for ordering” cards that comes before, with and after the product sales.</p>
<p>In summary, the term “Physical evidence” refers to ensuring that every component integrated with the product involved adheres to the same brand values as the product itself. This way, a consistent, satisfying experience can be assured both to the marketing team and the consumers involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not uncommon to hear people talking about the ingredients contained in a beauty or skincare product. In fact, it is the basis with which most people purchase their products. However, with the like of hyaluronic acid (HA) hitting the shelves more recently with lots of skincare products, it has left us wondering whether or not to see it as the hope or it is just a heaped hype.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is HA? Does it offer any major benefits and are there any effective ways it can be applied than the normal application?</p>
<h2><strong>Explaining hyaluronic acid! </strong></h2>
<p>Actually, hyaluronic acid is a humectant. A kind of substance capable of retaining moisture and coercing it with more weight in liquid. Naturally, this substance can be found in every part of the human body. Actually, the kind of HA utilizes dome sort of bacteria to make beauty and skincare products by sourcing it via a process called bio-fermentation in the laboratory.</p>
<p>However, as we continue to grow older, these substances in our body, including hyaluronic acid continues to decrease, thereby causing our skin to lose plumpness, hydration, and adequate volume.</p>
<h2><strong>How much quality does Hyaluronic Acid produce tends to give our body? </strong></h2>
<p>From the look of things, most of these HA-induced products claim to increase the quality value of the skin. How true is this claim?</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/best-accounting-help/">Writing errands: For best accounting help.</a></h2>
<p>Well, we&#8217;ll have to take a deeper look into the type of HA available in the product. Usually, HA isn’t usually of the same molecular sizes. While some are broken down, some are excessively massive in size. Meanwhile, the latter can not penetrate into the skin easily despite being able to bind water and hydrate the body. So when such HA-product is applied to the skin, it had little or no effects on it. Only the topmost layer of the skin is overly influenced. However, the same cannot be said for products with a smaller quantity of molecules. These one’s plunge through and deeper into the skin with ease.</p>
<p>In some embodiments, Hyaluronic Acids serves as dermal fillers, which are usually composed of HA in an injectable gel form. HA fillers include volume by practically overlaying their placement area and drawing in water to improve the filling effect. Once it is perfectly done, manufacturers can make use of HA fillers to make products that influence a lot of ornamental concerns, such as cheeks lifting, skin softening, augmenting sunken, dark, undereye circles, hydrating and enriching the lips, as well as stimulating the hands and earlobes.</p>
<p>To read more about how manufacturers exploit hyaluronic acids for cosmetic purposes, take a deep dive and read more about it <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.manufacturingchemist.com/news/article_page/Hyaluronic_acid_the_biotech_way/41631&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn8d2FhajnAhWMi1wKHVY3Dp8QFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VnNGVZwyqjSjsh-2skQY0">here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Hyaluronic worthy of the hype or is it just a sham? </strong></h2>
<p>So, is it safe to conclude that HA is the answer to our different cosmetic problems or is it just a hype from a selected public to sell products? To answer this, we must first establish the fact that topical HA is not as effective or strong as injectable HA filler which is capable of refurbishing lost skin quality. Although some topical HA products are ignorantly paraded as topical “fillers.” Notwithstanding, Topical HA is a terrific moisturizer. Yet, on the off chance that the major goal is to improve volume loss and skin autonomy that naturally comes with aging and dryness. Injectable HA would be a better choice and a more effective method than topical HA.</p>
<p>Don’t get this wrong, Topical HA has got lots of positive attributes. It tolerates quite well and does not usually cause allergic reactions which might result in skin irritation. More importantly, it is a good choice for pregnant and lactating mothers&#8217; skin.</p>
<p>However, for individuals with dry skin, or those with dewier, moisturized skin feel cravings during the cooler periods, a moisturizer or serum-containing HA is a great choice to utilize. But then, you have to be constantly reminded that topical HA will only hydrate the surface level of your skin and not penetrate deeper within it.</p>
<h2><strong>Final verdict</strong></h2>
<p>There is a surrounding doubt about hyaluronic acid being the latest cosmetic ingredient trends. Virtually every skincare product you see available in the market today contains it. From anti-aging creams, serums, acne prevention washes, to mask, sunscreen and other products, you’ll definitely find them there.</p>
<p>However, just as it is with other accepted skincare ingredients, HA is only valuable when it is used rightly. Should you be at taking off the visibility of facial wrinkles or to moisturize your skin, a cosmetic product containing hyaluronic acid would be a good choice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the same cannot be said for those looking to prevent acne or patches of skin hyperpigmentation. Rather, it would be better you take a look at another direction. Else, you’d be wasting your resources on what isn’t going to work for you. While hyaluronic acid works well to clear off anti-aging wrinkles and dehydration, it cannot solve every skincare problem. So, make your choice wisely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, over a quarter of the total baby births stories in the United States of America, and the world at large experienced birth defect. While some are minor and do not require any major medical treatment, others are very complicated and might result in serious health complications and could require surgery to correct. Let&#8217;s talk about birth defects in children</p>
<h2><strong>But what exactly are birth defects in children? </strong></h2>
<p>Simply put, birth defects in children are health conditions that happen before or after childbirth.  It could either be psychological, physical, or medical.</p>
<p>A recent study deduced that there are over  4,000 types of birth defects in children, hence making it challenging to affirm what exactly is a birth defect to other health conditions. Highlighted below are some of child defects issues:</p>
<p>Down syndrome</p>
<p>Cleft lip or palate</p>
<p>Cerebral palsy</p>
<p>Congenital heart defects</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome</p>
<p>Spina bifida</p>
<p>Upper and lower limb reduction defects</p>
<p>Club foot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Causes of Birth Defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Medical-wise, there are lots of factors that could result in birth defects in children. To put it mildly, it could result from genetic problems, environment, ingestion or even personal behaviors. Generally, a detectable birth defect is usually environmental, which might be as a result of the pregnant mother&#8217;s exposure to chemicals or problems with the genre of the baby.</p>
<p>Notable medical researches have proven that the following conditions and activities can influence the chance of birth defects during pregnancy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking certain medications</li>
<li>Smoking or dealing in drugs</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Certain medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</li>
</ul>
<p>As aforementioned, these are only a few activities and conditions that could lead to childbirth defects. There could be more than a thousand and one other reasons out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Preventing birth defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are remedial steps that can be taken to curtail birth defects during pregnancy. Should it be followed strictly, there is every chance that the pregnant mother will give birth without any form of defects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Visiting competent health care providers</strong>:</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon discovering that you’re pregnant,  your next shot should be how to schedule your session with your health care provider. The potentials of staying healthier are more when you register for ante-natal care with competent health care practitioners. Whilst you’ve gotten attended to, you should take the time to talk about every activity, medication, and complications you might be having with your doctor. This way, your gynecologist can put you through the necessities that would preferably put you on the high.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Vaccination matters: </strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One important factor that you greatly consider when having your appointment with your doctor is vaccination. You cannot underemphasize the importance one bit. Being vaccinated against flu and other sicknesses would go a long way to make sure that your pregnancy is healthy and you have a safe childbirth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Dealing with pre-existing conditions</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to take care of pre-existing health conditions before getting pregnant. Don’t get this wrong. You do have the right to be pregnant whenever you want to so long as you have the all-round means to take care of a child. But then, you should consider the future of the child and not subject him/her to pains or discomfort. Even you, you deserve painless childbirth. Hence, you have to take care of any conditions that can hinder you from this happiness. A good example of problems you have to deal with is diabetes and obesity. These two have a high potential of badly affecting childbirth. Take every precaution you can so you can be on a high every time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Folic Acid is important</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under every circumstance, a pregnant woman should ingest 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Even so, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get prepared before the said time. With the constant taking of prenatal supplements and multivitamins, you should be able to get enough folic acid sustenance to last you for a while.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>A foreign substance is a no-no</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a pregnant woman, you don’t have any business engaging in smoking, taking hard drugs or alcohol. Aside from pregnancy, these habits are injurious to health. And since you have another “flexible” life in you to worry about, you really should do away with it totally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Family History and healthy living</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even without being told, healthy living is essential to living well. However, with pregnancy now in the picture, it can help deal with birth defects. Eating healthy and engaging in healthy activities would go a long way to making your baby healthy.</p>
<p>Also, in the case that your family has a history of defects during childbirth, then this is the right time to discuss it with your doctor.  Your gynecologist can refer you to a genetic counselor or therapist that will help determine the potential of your child being not with a defect or not.</p>
<p>However, even after prenatal testing and you know that your baby has the potential of being born with a defect, then you really shouldn’t be worried or be sick over it.  You’re not alone in this quest. There are laid down programs to support pregnant women with possible childbirth defects. Simply enroll in one and get familiar with what to expect until, when and after your baby arrives. You, your baby and family will appreciate you for that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you experience some sort of discomfort in your body system, the best thing you have to do is to report to your doctor and do physical therapy. When running the physical therapy, you can share the information about how you feel and see whether the doctor can proffer medication to help you out.</p>
<p>At some point, these medications work. And sometimes, they don’t. Now you become bothered as to what could be the reasons why you are not getting better. Even then, you opt to go for a complete scan and checkup to ascertain what could be wrong with you but the results come back negative. You are perfectly alright. But you know you are not. What could be wrong with you? Why are you still feeling the discomfort in your body system even when the test and scan prove otherwise? Not even the administered medications are working?</p>
<p>Without any doubt, all of these thoughts must definitely occupy your mind. You feel upset since you’re not in any way closer to identifying what the problem is. But you’ve got your ever-qualified doctor urging you to stay calm. He wants to refer you to a physical therapist.  He wants to book you an appointment to meet another “medical practitioner.”</p>
<p>What? You don’t seem to like the sound of that, do you? Your major scare is that you don’t know how it would feel like. If you had your way, you’d leave it and not continue with the therapy.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>But you’re wrong. Physical therapy isn’t as complex or wrong as you seem to visualize it. Rather, it is one of the best things that can happen to your health. Yet, the news doesn’t come that bountifully. You want a specific break down. Well, we’ve got that for you. Let’s deal with it, one step at a time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>First, what is physical therapy? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a simple definition, we&#8217;d define physical therapy as a kind of medical solution that doesn’t require you to take medications or undergo surgery. But then, it is a treatment for “ailing” patients.</p>
<p>How’s that even possible? Well, in physical therapy, the therapist examines the patient and creates a treatment technique plan to enhance or better still, deal with the discomfort in the body system. What this means is that PT ( as we&#8217;ll be referring to physical therapy for the most part of this article) utilizes a system to adequately improve the life of the individual involved and potentially bring down ailing symptoms.</p>
<p>And just as the fingers on our hands differ, there are a lot of disparities as to why people visit therapists. While it is a recovery process for some, to others, it is a balancing process to perfect healing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>How can physical therapy help you?</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s navigate to the next part since you already know what physical therapy is all about? How can it help you?</p>
<p>Well, just like it is stipulated in the definition, physical therapy is a healing process for people suffering from different medical conditions. For clarification purpose, here are few people that are eligible to apply for physical therapy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sport injuries</li>
<li>Balance and Walking problems</li>
<li>Age-related issues</li>
<li>Neurological problems</li>
<li>Heart and Lung diseases.</li>
<li>Cancer patients and many other patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, regardless of what your health issue is, PT has got something to get back on track in no time.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>How does a Physical Therapist treats me since there are no medications or surgeries? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, physical therapists are professional observers. They can see right through you even before conducting a test or running a scan on you. Their major obligation is to get to the root of your discomfort. This is to say,  they are not just like your regular doctors, they are way more than that. They have amassed an advanced level of education to enable them to operate as they are.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if there’s a need to transfer your case to medical doctor or surgeon, they’d be the first to know and make sure that they follow you to the latter and make sure that they find a cure to your sickness. Yet, more than just treat your symptoms, physical therapists make sure to discuss your daily activities and how to prevent further occurrence(s).</p>
<h2><strong>What goes on in a physical therapy session?</strong></h2>
<p>Usually, a  physical therapy session doesn’t exceed  45–60 minutes. However, during your primary session, here are some things you should expect;</p>
<p><strong>Medical History Review</strong>: Although it is very likely that your therapist already has your medical background, he or she might still have to discuss it with you in detail. This will ensure that there isn’t a mix-up or problems in determining your present problem.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Examination</strong>: Just like every medical practitioner, your therapist will have to conduct a test in you. He will have to check out every part of your body and be certain that you have the necessary flexibility and balance. You may need to engage in some activities to determine this anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>: Unlike many other treatments, PT isn’t a one-time thing. Rather, it is a continuous treatment that your therapist must have developed to make sure you’re good to go in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Depending on the plan you’re on, you may have to engage in some extra-curricular activities at home, which you must have to balance and report back to your therapist to ensure that you’re recovering.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Physical therapy ensures that you get the best of treatment to put in the right place. With it, you can bid the world of discomfort and pain in no time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to general growing health statistics all over the world, fiber is one of the major reasons why the whole grain&#8217;s sustenance is good for you. In fact, many health practitioners prove that regular ingest of fiber in your food gives you a better chance of reducing chronic diseases and have great digestion.  More than these, there are a lot more than you can actually get from eating fiber. In a bid to affirm the importance of ingesting fiber, health authorities recommend that the male and female folks eat as much as 38 and 25 fiber grams respectively in other to have a healthy diet every day.</p>
<p>To further enlighten us better about the benefits of having fibers in our diets, this article provides us with health evidence to keep us on the high.  Yet, before we venture into it, let’s deal with the following question.</p>
<h2><strong><em>What Is Fiber?</em></strong></h2>
<p>In a layman explanation, dietary fiber is the non-digestible carbohydrate available in our foods.  Meanwhile, it is further divided into two which will help you to have a healthy diet;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soluble fiber</strong>: These are the kind of fibers that can be dissolved in water and has the capacity to be broken down by guts bacteria.</li>
<li><strong>Insoluble fiber</strong>: These are the direct opposite of soluble fibers. They are non-dissolvable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, it is important to remember that fibers come in different forms. While some of them are necessary health-wise, the others are basically useless.  Further extension between soluble and insoluble fibers explains that the latter has the capacity to be digested by the good bacteria in the intestine, and most foods contain both forms of fibers.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<h2><strong>The importance of eating fibers for a healthy diet</strong></h2>
<p>We have highlighted some of the major important reasons for eating fibers. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Fiber is essential for a healthy diet and food for &#8220;Good&#8221; Gut Bacteria </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, there are more bacteria in the human body than the number of cells. It ratios with a difference of 10 to 1.   Bacteria that live in the human body outnumber the body&#8217;s cells 10 to 1.</p>
<p>Usually, the primary place of abode for this bacteria is in the mouth, the skin, nose and majorly in the large intestine guts, numbering more than 500 different species and about 100 trillion cells.</p>
<p>Hey, don’t be scared by the huge numbers of bacteria available in your body. It’s rather a good thing and there is a beneficial mutual relationship. A good number of these bacteria make it easier for you to digest food and help your body deal with certain irregularities. You, in return, serve as a host where they live.</p>
<p>Some of the mutual benefits that you earn from the relationship include regulating blood sugar, optimal brain functions, weight control, and even some immune system functionality.</p>
<p>Yes, but what has Fiber got to do with all of these?</p>
<p>Well, just like every other organism, there is a need for your bacteria to eat and earn survival energy to function well. Since most foods are absorbed into the bloodstream before they find their way into the large intestine, only little is left for the guts bacteria to feed on.</p>
<p>So, you see where fiber comes in handy! Normally, the human cells are unable to produce the enzyme that can process fibers, hence it is left untouched till it gets to the guts. Only then can the bacteria there has a swell time, processing them and making them function as prebiotics.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Fibers help in controlling excessive weight through a healthy diet</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you don’t know, fibers can be efficiently helpful when watching weight by ameliorating your appetite.</p>
<p>Certain studies put it that ingesting a good amount of dietary fiber can influence weight loss by naturally taking down the intake of calories.</p>
<p>Fiber actually soaks up water from the intestine by slowly absorbing the nutrients of the diet and giving a complete feeling of fullness. However, it depends on the kind of fiber involved.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Influences Blood Sugar Spikes</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Foods that contain a high amount of fiber have the potentials of having a lower glycemic index than their refined carb, off-fiber counterpart. Thus, it is more important to eat high-viscosity and soluble fibers.</p>
<p>With these forms of fiber, there are greater advantages that you’d amass the little number of sugar spikes and thereby reduce your chances of high blood pressure.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong>How about Constipation issues? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important considerable factor about the fiber is its capacity to reduce constipation. Generally, fiber absorbs water.  And as such, the bulk of your stool is soaked up and sped through your intestine with ease. However, there is a shred of more conflicting evidence to back up this claim.</p>
<p>While certain studies prove that the intake of fiber improves constipation symptoms, other studies have countered this claim by affirming that fiber reduces constipation. In actuality, both claims are correct. The effects are dependent on the kind of fiber being ingested.  Hence, it is important that you contact a health professional, preferably a nutritionist to put you through the kind of fiber that is best for you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you’re gunning to lead a healthy lifestyle and have a healthy diet, ensure that you eat adequate healthy foods such as grains, nuts, fruits and vegetables that contain adequate fiber. Be guided, your Health is your Wealth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business page is probably one of your most powerful tools at your disposal right now. But then, the blog might not be as efficient as it should. Why is this so? Well, the reasons are numerous but we won’t be focusing majorly on that. Rather, we will be discussing how to structure your business blog posts on your business blog to enable maximum conversion.</p>
<p>Quite tyrannical, is it? Don’t be too hard on yourself, we’ve got your back. With this article, you should be ready to roll in no time. Let’s begin.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structuring your business blog posts</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, there are certain elements that are key in every blog post and domain.  While some are easily noticeable, the others aren’t but altogether, they play an essential role in making or marring your life. Here’s what you should consider when structuring a blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary business page navigation</strong>: Regardless of whether the user isn’t checking out the business section of your blog, it a important that you make them learn about your business; the services you offer and the goods you sell. You can do this by including a simple navigation menu to the primary business page.</li>
<li><strong>Content grouping</strong>: Now that you have got guests on your platform, you should encourage them to stay. Ensure that they can browse through available content with ease by grouping the content, either by content, topic of skill level.</li>
<li><strong>Search box</strong>: Users should be able to look up for what they are exactly looking for by simply teaching for it. A simple search box on the side is enough for that.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">HOW TO FACILITATE A PROPER BOOK REVIEW </a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subscription options:</strong> Readers should be encouraged to follow up on the content on your blog. You’d do well by including a way to subscribe to your content either via RSS or email.</li>
<li><strong>Preview posts are important</strong>:  Most of the time, we tend to have scanners, then real viewers or readers. Allow them the opportunity to skim your contents by offering them preview posts. If you can, include a clickable image to draw in more attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, every one of your business blog posts should have five essential characteristics, including the content itself.   The elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call-to-Actions (CTAs):</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, this element is very essential for your blog post to make conversions. The more you dedicate to it, the more conversion you’re more likely to have. Of course, you don’t have any excuse not to have it. They are the essentiality on which your readers’ interest are developed. To the layman, CTAs aren’t really worth too much attention, after all it is just a button. Yes, this is right but trust me, the last thing you want to do now is to lose valuable conversions. You’d be killing the business even before it got started. However, there quite a lot of ways you can optimize your CTAs. You just have to look through what exactly will work for you. Once you’ve successfully done this, you are one step ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>: Hey, don’t be a boring host. Your blog post shouldn’t be all about“business-like” text. No, it might sound boring to some readers. Try including at least an image to spice up the readers psyche.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Quick load time</strong></h3>
<p>: As aforesaid, most online shoppers and readers are more scanners than readers. They don’t have the liberty of patience to wait for your page to load for lengthy periods. So, you should ensure that your business page doesn’t take more than three seconds before it can be accessed. If you can, a less than 2 seconds period is just good enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are done with structuring your page, let’s move on to the next important thing.</p>
<h2>          2.    SEO of your business blog posts</h2>
<p>Well, no blog content goes past without saying more than a “Hi” to this. Trust me, you need to be familiar with this.  While you’re aiming to reach your targeted audience, you should also consider search engine optimization.  You need as many inorganic guests as you need organic ones. After all, it is for the growth of your business. Here’s what you should do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporate your blog with the primary business page domain</strong>: Make sure to host your blog page within your fundamental domain rather than externally hosting your blog. This way, you wouldn’t have to murder the SEO administration by causing two domains to compete against themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A keyword-focused page title is essential</strong>&#8211; Rather than denoting your blog with “Company’s Blog”, you should consider the opportunity keyword optimization is offering you. Since search engines emphasize left-closed words, your blog&#8217;s page title should be named with something that is keyword-related before even including your company’s name. This way, you can actually lay proper claims for those keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-descriptions are equally great</strong> &#8211; These are more of a summary description of your search engines webpage. Ensure that your post contains this description, one of the obviously related keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t forget internal links:</strong> While you are navigating to other blog structure contents, you shouldn’t forget about linking relevant content from one post to another. Provide your reader with internally linked to other pages within your domain with relevant strategic caster text to enable better keyword ranking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve successfully integrated all of these, then you would have successfully given your blogpost a boost to rank better on SEO</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Social Media</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every business blog owner wants to share their content with every part of cyberspace. But the question is; how prepared are these contents for social media? Are they properly optimized? If not, then you need to go back and integrate steps 1 and 2 of this piece to your business webpage. Only then are you worthy of considering this phase. But how do you know whether or not your blog is rightly optimized? Well, we dealt with that in this piece.</p>
<p>First off, you have to optimize your blog  homepage and then follow these social tips.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Provide your guest with social subscription options in your business blog posts: </strong></h3>
<p>Give your readers the option to follow your blog on any social network they prefer. This would encourage better interaction on the social media, away from the blog itself.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Social proof display: </strong></h3>
<p>This is proof that your audience is motivated socially, not just by your blog posts. To achieve this, you have to ensure that there is social interaction on your blog. If you can, create a live-feed of how people are tweeting on your business social network handle.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it. Quite a lot of optimizing it is. But then, if you’re able to take the time to integrate every of the mentioned phases and sub-phases in this article, you are good to go. You don’t have to be a multi-billion dollar firm before you can reach out to the social network, you could run your business page right there where you’re sorted by creating unique business blog posts. You just have to get it right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world, our well-being is very important, too many ailments have been around like never before. We must advocate for our own health. You have to realize this &#8211; it is you, not your doctors are in charge of the quality of your medical care. They aren&#8217;t gods, and you are not a wuss. I hope you get this? Always strive to <strong>get the best medical care</strong>, you are entitled to it.</p>
<p>To be in charge of your medical care, and getting the best out of it, you need to do this first &#8211; shift your notion of doctors being some benevolent dictators. They are not, they are your employees. Just like you would expect from other businesses. So, demand good customer service from your doctors/hospitals.</p>
<p>In this article, you will read about some steps that can help you get the best medical care from your doctors and hospitals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Steps for getting the best medical care</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Always use schedules</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to make it a practice to update your appointments with your, dentist, doctor and other healthcare providers &#8211; be it on a paper calendar or a digital one. Some digital devices can also be used to alert you on upcoming appointments. Schedule appointments a week or two ahead using a reminder. Reschedules should also be updated. This will prevent you from missing appointments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Don&#8217;t be reactive, be proactive if you want best medical care</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To be a proactive patient, you do more than just walking into an examining room and waiting for your physician to fix you. You should be actively interested in getting the best healthcare &#8211; no matter what the sacrifice is needed to achieve this important goal.</p>
<p>You can also be more proactive by always keeping a journal available for questions and observations during your appointments. This will help you get the best out of your visit time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always speak up</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, you feel reluctant to speak to your doctor, believing that the symptoms would go gone on their own. Some of these issues can be symptoms &#8220;down there&#8221;. To get the best medical care out there, you must not be shy.</p>
<p>The fact is, doctors have seen and heard different kinds of complaints regarding symptoms or diseases. Don&#8217;t ever feel embarrassed. If it&#8217;s that serious, just speak up about it. Always open up to your doctors. They can&#8217;t help you if you don&#8217;t reveal what you are dealing with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always ask for medical records</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a smart move. No matter the condition of your medical issue, serious or just checkups, develop a habit of asking your physician for your medical records. And when you get them, always read them.</p>
<p>You still need the information within your health records, even though those records belong to your doctor. There might be little charges for those copies, but with the information in these reports, you have your health history at your fingertips &#8211; they are very useful in emergency issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Make sure you follow up</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you have a medical test, for example, go further by asking your doctor when to expect your test results. Write the date down and always follow up with your doctor&#8217;s office with calls, from time to time.</p>
<p>And no, you are not bothering them, it&#8217;s a priority for you, and you have absolute right to do so. Remember, he/she is your employee.</p>
<p>Lack of effective communication with your physician can cost you a lot. Always follow up for useful updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Use your basic instinct if you want the best medical care</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, some illnesses can be difficult for doctors to diagnose. They may tell you that you are fine and just give you certain prescriptions. A patient may find out that the treatment isn&#8217;t working. With time, your gut can give you more signs that you need more opinions for different diagnoses.</p>
<p>If you have confidence in your instincts, it can save you a lot of time. And this makes it easier for your physician to guide you. Pay attention, your gut always tells you something about your health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always be informed</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though physicians can&#8217;t know it all regarding our health, we still expect them to.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to wait till you are diagnosed with a critical illness before taking basic actions, always get informed.</p>
<p>You need to always push for answers when certain symptoms occur. Only you know your body best. Your doctor won&#8217;t always have all the answers to every disease.</p>
<p>Always ask important questions as to when needed and do personal research from reliable sources. Remember, it&#8217;s always your health, always be your own very best advocate.</p>
<p>With what was discussed above, you are on a sure way to <strong>getting the best medical care</strong>. Use these strategies and you will be in charge of your health.</p>
