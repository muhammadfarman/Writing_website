<h1><strong> COVID 19 IN EDUCATION SECTOR</strong></h1>
<p>coronavirus pandemic is a health crisis that  people are experiencing globally. It has posed a great challenge to the world as no cure has been found. This is due to its effects not only to the health sector but also to the socio-economic sectors. Most countries have decided and taken actions to alleviate the growth and development of a full-blown pandemic. Therefore countries have gone into localized closures. Schools, universities and all education systems have been closed down. As they can be a faster means of spreading the virus. This has resulted in home-schooling especially in countries that have been heavily affected. Countries such as Italy, Iran, and Korea. These changes in the education system have brought about inconveniences. However, innovation and invention within the sector get promption. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting influence on learning and its activities.</p>
<h3><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Growth in public-private educational partnerships</strong></a></h3>
<p>Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, there will be growth in public-private education partnerships. Different stakeholders within the education sector are on the lookout for solutions. In some countries, students engage in homeschooling. Where interactive applications is in use to enhance it. Others are using live television broadcasts. Where all learning materials are being made available. While in some, less innovative solutions are being implemented. Such as the use of Google Classroom where face to face instructions are given. All these solutions have assisted in keeping students busy while at home. Through the concept of digitization in education, learning anywhere, anytime might be the new trend in the education system.</p>
<p>The digital platforms that are being used are a result of combined efforts by learning coalitions and stakeholders. The stakeholders such as the government, education professionals, technology providers, and network providers. Through this education has received more attention. Going beyond the projects that are being funded by the government and non-profit social projects. Private organizations such as Microsoft and Google have developed a great interest and are investing in innovative education solutions. Both the private sector and government are arising to the authority of educated people. However, due to the pandemic, there is a limit on the carrying out of initiatives. However, it is evident that after the pandemic large-scale and cross-industry partnerships would be established. Involving the private and public sector with a common goal of providing education in the most convenient way.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Effects of the partnerships</strong></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/annual-report/mobilizing-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth of these partnerships has begun</a>. For example in China, the Ministry of Education has assembled diverse parties. Who have contributed to the development of a new cloud-based, online learning and broadcasting platform.  This has led also to the upgrading of the education infrastructure in China. Which has been led by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and other stakeholders. Also, in Hong Kong a readtogether platform has been developed. It is an association with over 60 education organizations, the media, professions in the entertainment industry, and publishers.  Through this platform, educational resources and materials are provided. Materials such as assessment tools, book chapters, videos, and free counseling services.  The association aims and making use and upholding the platform in the future even after the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The development of these partnerships will be a trend. This is especially in countries where the government has been predominantly providing education. However, policies and regulations will need to be put in place. They will contribute to the execution and implementation of common goals. This will provide a clear guideline of how the partnerships will work, the contribution of each party, how decisions will be made.  In these, a code of conduct is emphasizes, ways of handling and managing conflict and ways of reaching a consensus in the case of disagreements. This ensures equity and fairness for both the private and public sectors.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits to the education system </strong></h3>
<p>This will greatly boost the education system leading to an educated populace. Through this, some of the major issues get solution over time. Issues such as unemployment, poverty, and underdevelopment. Education equips the population with the required skills, knowledge, and expertise in different professions. Through which people can seek employment, create employment opportunities, and come up with inventions and innovations within different sectors. Thus a majority of a country&#8217;s population engage in economic activities.</p>
<p>That enable them to earn a living. Therefore leading to high standards of life and reduced levels of poverty. Innovations and inventions are a major source of attraction to foreign investors. Therefore, boosting the economy of countries. The partnerships within the education sector may prompt partnerships in other sectors. Sectors such as the health sector, hospitality, and food sector among others. This brings about unity, equity, cooperation and effective use of resources. As the different sectors of a country’s economy are focusing on common goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>In conclusion, The COVID 19 pandemic has brought about inconveniences. However it is also prompting changes whose effects will be of benefit. Therefore as we find temporary solutions  to the problems arising, it is also important to look into permanent solutions for some of these issues. The COVID 19 pandemic has brought about a change in different sectors. It is therefore a primary responsibility and obligation to the world population to swiftly adapt. Adapting to the new changes and develop mechanisms. Which encourage growth and development. Therefore development despite the effects of the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing is the ultimate link that connects customers to your product. However, the supreme driver of these links to your product is the product marketing manager (PMM), the individual that knows your actual customers.</p>
<p>In truth, as a product marketing manager, you’re on the verge of growing your company by connecting customers to your product.  But then, it is not as easy as it sounds. Nevertheless, we have summed a comprehensive guide to help you properly implement a working strategy that works for your product marketing.</p>
<p>But one quick question pops to mind.</p>
<h3>How are product management and product marketing related?</h3>
<p>Well, you probably might have seen the term “product management” often used on business blogs and mostly used to refer to marketing. Now you’re at a crossroad to know whether they mean the same thing or not.?</p>
<p>Actually, you’re not alone. A lot of people, even business enthusiasts often confuse product marketing with product management.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>While product marketing often falls under the jurisdiction of a marketing department team to engage customers to buy directly from the company, product management, on the other hand, covers every purview about the product’s entire cycle from its manufacturer to sale and even more to the final consumer. Click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/marketing-sales/marketing-promotion/marketing-basics/seven-ps-marketing&amp;ved=2ahUKEwisvrPV_rHnAhXRQkEAHdrkCHUQFjAMegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MIVjo8zSuA7AVNpz12Vzo&amp;cshid=1580617774561">here</a> if you’d like to have deeper, in-depth knowledge about the 7 P&#8217;s of product marketing strategy</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding the 7 P&#8217;s of Product Marketing Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Professional product marketers often refer to some precepts while dealing with business. These precepts are the basis on which strategies are built.  To the non-initiate, it is simply the “Seven Ps” of marketing, but to kick-ass marketers, it is the seven pillars of commerce.  Let’s delve deeper to see the reason behind this notion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Product</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin with, you cannot go into marketing without having a specific product or products in mind. Meanwhile, your products might span across different things depending on the kind of company you operate on.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the product, you’re into, you stand a better chance of leveraging your product by integrating the seven Ps for better sales. More importantly, you stand a better chance when you know the product you’re dealing with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next on our list of seven Ps is pricing. It is important to know that you just cannot fail to consider pricing when you already have your product. Even if you don’t have many competitions, you have to consider pricing in such a way that your customers are overly considered and they can be influenced overly to patronize you.</p>
<p>At this point, it is just more than setting a price tag on a product and expects your customers to pay. No, it goes way beyond that. This time, you have to overly consider whether or not the general market ecosystem satisfies with your product and the subsequent pricing. Here, you’ve got to answer wavering questions like &#8211; How much is my product overly in demand? How well does my pricing fit into my potential customers&#8217; budget? Do I have people selling the same products, if yes, what’s their pricing like? These and many other questions are the questions that should ravage through your mind as you set your pricing for your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Place</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the laymen, place refers solely to the location as far as product marketing is concerned, but then it goes way beyond that. Actually, they refer to the distribution strategy you have out in place to get your product across to your customers.  It refers to the channel put in place to make sure that once your product is already known, and your price set, you can get to your specific customers without any hassles. That way, you have them coming back to patronize your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every of the seven Ps in product marketing is important but then, we must pay close attention to the fourth P, Promotion.</p>
<p>More than just advertising, promotion goes deeper as to how your product is presented to the outside world. Does your product sit well in the mind of the consumers when it is been advertise? How much of a solid influence does your product have? How many customers seeing your ad are more willing to take the step to patronize you? These and many other questions are what make up your promotion. Although it is advertising, it is however basically on another level entirely. This time, it covers brand awareness, lead acquisition, demand generation, product differentiation as well as product messaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Process</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The product marketing process is the absoluteness that links the product marketing campaign to their major consumers. Simply put, the process in product marketing refers to the “conditions” put in place by the project team/ manager for customers to complete before getting a product.  This time around, it encompasses the other four Ps – the Product, Pricing, Place And Promotion. Hence, it makes way more easy to know who your real customers are and help you devise a method to keep them glued to you while you source for more patronage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>People</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, other Ps are useless without this P. Don’t get it all wrong. Other P&#8217;s are just as important as each other. but then, without people, then theirs is no market. You have this P happening straight from the production chain of delivery to the very last P of physical evidence. People are needed to make up the team that would deliver the product. You need people with quality and skills that can help make the product a success, even in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>Also, people are needed in distributing your product to the right consumers. People are needed to advertise your business. You need people to consume your product. In short, your product needs people to fully the right pricing. Of course, the sole reason your marketing team is working so hard is basically because of making sales. So, it is close to impossible to refuse not to be concerned about people when dealing with marketing. They are the bedrock to determine whether you’ll advance in the commerce spree or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Physical evidence</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find read the sixth P, about people, then you probably know we will be addressing “Physical Evidence” as our final P. This P is concerned with addressing every physical context that happens all through the course of your marketing. This includes every paraphernalia such as confirmation emails, PDF invoices, receipts, and even the “thanks for ordering” cards that comes before, with and after the product sales.</p>
<p>In summary, the term “Physical evidence” refers to ensuring that every component integrated with the product involved adheres to the same brand values as the product itself. This way, a consistent, satisfying experience can be assured both to the marketing team and the consumers involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, over a quarter of the total baby births stories in the United States of America, and the world at large experienced birth defect. While some are minor and do not require any major medical treatment, others are very complicated and might result in serious health complications and could require surgery to correct. Let&#8217;s talk about birth defects in children</p>
<h2><strong>But what exactly are birth defects in children? </strong></h2>
<p>Simply put, birth defects in children are health conditions that happen before or after childbirth.  It could either be psychological, physical, or medical.</p>
<p>A recent study deduced that there are over  4,000 types of birth defects in children, hence making it challenging to affirm what exactly is a birth defect to other health conditions. Highlighted below are some of child defects issues:</p>
<p>Down syndrome</p>
<p>Cleft lip or palate</p>
<p>Cerebral palsy</p>
<p>Congenital heart defects</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome</p>
<p>Spina bifida</p>
<p>Upper and lower limb reduction defects</p>
<p>Club foot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Causes of Birth Defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Medical-wise, there are lots of factors that could result in birth defects in children. To put it mildly, it could result from genetic problems, environment, ingestion or even personal behaviors. Generally, a detectable birth defect is usually environmental, which might be as a result of the pregnant mother&#8217;s exposure to chemicals or problems with the genre of the baby.</p>
<p>Notable medical researches have proven that the following conditions and activities can influence the chance of birth defects during pregnancy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking certain medications</li>
<li>Smoking or dealing in drugs</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Certain medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</li>
</ul>
<p>As aforementioned, these are only a few activities and conditions that could lead to childbirth defects. There could be more than a thousand and one other reasons out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Preventing birth defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are remedial steps that can be taken to curtail birth defects during pregnancy. Should it be followed strictly, there is every chance that the pregnant mother will give birth without any form of defects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Visiting competent health care providers</strong>:</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon discovering that you’re pregnant,  your next shot should be how to schedule your session with your health care provider. The potentials of staying healthier are more when you register for ante-natal care with competent health care practitioners. Whilst you’ve gotten attended to, you should take the time to talk about every activity, medication, and complications you might be having with your doctor. This way, your gynecologist can put you through the necessities that would preferably put you on the high.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Vaccination matters: </strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One important factor that you greatly consider when having your appointment with your doctor is vaccination. You cannot underemphasize the importance one bit. Being vaccinated against flu and other sicknesses would go a long way to make sure that your pregnancy is healthy and you have a safe childbirth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Dealing with pre-existing conditions</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to take care of pre-existing health conditions before getting pregnant. Don’t get this wrong. You do have the right to be pregnant whenever you want to so long as you have the all-round means to take care of a child. But then, you should consider the future of the child and not subject him/her to pains or discomfort. Even you, you deserve painless childbirth. Hence, you have to take care of any conditions that can hinder you from this happiness. A good example of problems you have to deal with is diabetes and obesity. These two have a high potential of badly affecting childbirth. Take every precaution you can so you can be on a high every time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Folic Acid is important</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under every circumstance, a pregnant woman should ingest 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Even so, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get prepared before the said time. With the constant taking of prenatal supplements and multivitamins, you should be able to get enough folic acid sustenance to last you for a while.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>A foreign substance is a no-no</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a pregnant woman, you don’t have any business engaging in smoking, taking hard drugs or alcohol. Aside from pregnancy, these habits are injurious to health. And since you have another “flexible” life in you to worry about, you really should do away with it totally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Family History and healthy living</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even without being told, healthy living is essential to living well. However, with pregnancy now in the picture, it can help deal with birth defects. Eating healthy and engaging in healthy activities would go a long way to making your baby healthy.</p>
<p>Also, in the case that your family has a history of defects during childbirth, then this is the right time to discuss it with your doctor.  Your gynecologist can refer you to a genetic counselor or therapist that will help determine the potential of your child being not with a defect or not.</p>
<p>However, even after prenatal testing and you know that your baby has the potential of being born with a defect, then you really shouldn’t be worried or be sick over it.  You’re not alone in this quest. There are laid down programs to support pregnant women with possible childbirth defects. Simply enroll in one and get familiar with what to expect until, when and after your baby arrives. You, your baby and family will appreciate you for that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you experience some sort of discomfort in your body system, the best thing you have to do is to report to your doctor and do physical therapy. When running the physical therapy, you can share the information about how you feel and see whether the doctor can proffer medication to help you out.</p>
<p>At some point, these medications work. And sometimes, they don’t. Now you become bothered as to what could be the reasons why you are not getting better. Even then, you opt to go for a complete scan and checkup to ascertain what could be wrong with you but the results come back negative. You are perfectly alright. But you know you are not. What could be wrong with you? Why are you still feeling the discomfort in your body system even when the test and scan prove otherwise? Not even the administered medications are working?</p>
<p>Without any doubt, all of these thoughts must definitely occupy your mind. You feel upset since you’re not in any way closer to identifying what the problem is. But you’ve got your ever-qualified doctor urging you to stay calm. He wants to refer you to a physical therapist.  He wants to book you an appointment to meet another “medical practitioner.”</p>
<p>What? You don’t seem to like the sound of that, do you? Your major scare is that you don’t know how it would feel like. If you had your way, you’d leave it and not continue with the therapy.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>But you’re wrong. Physical therapy isn’t as complex or wrong as you seem to visualize it. Rather, it is one of the best things that can happen to your health. Yet, the news doesn’t come that bountifully. You want a specific break down. Well, we’ve got that for you. Let’s deal with it, one step at a time.</p>

<p>For a simple definition, we&#8217;d define physical therapy as a kind of medical solution that doesn’t require you to take medications or undergo surgery. But then, it is a treatment for “ailing” patients.</p>
<p>How’s that even possible? Well, in physical therapy, the therapist examines the patient and creates a treatment technique plan to enhance or better still, deal with the discomfort in the body system. What this means is that PT ( as we&#8217;ll be referring to physical therapy for the most part of this article) utilizes a system to adequately improve the life of the individual involved and potentially bring down ailing symptoms.</p>
<p>And just as the fingers on our hands differ, there are a lot of disparities as to why people visit therapists. While it is a recovery process for some, to others, it is a balancing process to perfect healing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>How can physical therapy help you?</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s navigate to the next part since you already know what physical therapy is all about? How can it help you?</p>
<p>Well, just like it is stipulated in the definition, physical therapy is a healing process for people suffering from different medical conditions. For clarification purpose, here are few people that are eligible to apply for physical therapy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sport injuries</li>
<li>Balance and Walking problems</li>
<li>Age-related issues</li>
<li>Neurological problems</li>
<li>Heart and Lung diseases.</li>
<li>Cancer patients and many other patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, regardless of what your health issue is, PT has got something to get back on track in no time.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>How does a Physical Therapist treats me since there are no medications or surgeries? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, physical therapists are professional observers. They can see right through you even before conducting a test or running a scan on you. Their major obligation is to get to the root of your discomfort. This is to say,  they are not just like your regular doctors, they are way more than that. They have amassed an advanced level of education to enable them to operate as they are.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if there’s a need to transfer your case to medical doctor or surgeon, they’d be the first to know and make sure that they follow you to the latter and make sure that they find a cure to your sickness. Yet, more than just treat your symptoms, physical therapists make sure to discuss your daily activities and how to prevent further occurrence(s).</p>
<h2><strong>What goes on in a physical therapy session?</strong></h2>
<p>Usually, a  physical therapy session doesn’t exceed  45–60 minutes. However, during your primary session, here are some things you should expect;</p>
<p><strong>Medical History Review</strong>: Although it is very likely that your therapist already has your medical background, he or she might still have to discuss it with you in detail. This will ensure that there isn’t a mix-up or problems in determining your present problem.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Examination</strong>: Just like every medical practitioner, your therapist will have to conduct a test in you. He will have to check out every part of your body and be certain that you have the necessary flexibility and balance. You may need to engage in some activities to determine this anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>: Unlike many other treatments, PT isn’t a one-time thing. Rather, it is a continuous treatment that your therapist must have developed to make sure you’re good to go in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Depending on the plan you’re on, you may have to engage in some extra-curricular activities at home, which you must have to balance and report back to your therapist to ensure that you’re recovering.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Physical therapy ensures that you get the best of treatment to put in the right place. With it, you can bid the world of discomfort and pain in no time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to general growing health statistics all over the world, fiber is one of the major reasons why the whole grain&#8217;s sustenance is good for you. In fact, many health practitioners prove that regular ingest of fiber in your food gives you a better chance of reducing chronic diseases and have great digestion.  More than these, there are a lot more than you can actually get from eating fiber. In a bid to affirm the importance of ingesting fiber, health authorities recommend that the male and female folks eat as much as 38 and 25 fiber grams respectively in other to have a healthy diet every day.</p>
<p>To further enlighten us better about the benefits of having fibers in our diets, this article provides us with health evidence to keep us on the high.  Yet, before we venture into it, let’s deal with the following question.</p>
<h2><strong><em>What Is Fiber?</em></strong></h2>
<p>In a layman explanation, dietary fiber is the non-digestible carbohydrate available in our foods.  Meanwhile, it is further divided into two which will help you to have a healthy diet;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soluble fiber</strong>: These are the kind of fibers that can be dissolved in water and has the capacity to be broken down by guts bacteria.</li>
<li><strong>Insoluble fiber</strong>: These are the direct opposite of soluble fibers. They are non-dissolvable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, it is important to remember that fibers come in different forms. While some of them are necessary health-wise, the others are basically useless.  Further extension between soluble and insoluble fibers explains that the latter has the capacity to be digested by the good bacteria in the intestine, and most foods contain both forms of fibers.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<h2><strong>The importance of eating fibers for a healthy diet</strong></h2>
<p>We have highlighted some of the major important reasons for eating fibers. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Fiber is essential for a healthy diet and food for &#8220;Good&#8221; Gut Bacteria </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, there are more bacteria in the human body than the number of cells. It ratios with a difference of 10 to 1.   Bacteria that live in the human body outnumber the body&#8217;s cells 10 to 1.</p>
<p>Usually, the primary place of abode for this bacteria is in the mouth, the skin, nose and majorly in the large intestine guts, numbering more than 500 different species and about 100 trillion cells.</p>
<p>Hey, don’t be scared by the huge numbers of bacteria available in your body. It’s rather a good thing and there is a beneficial mutual relationship. A good number of these bacteria make it easier for you to digest food and help your body deal with certain irregularities. You, in return, serve as a host where they live.</p>
<p>Some of the mutual benefits that you earn from the relationship include regulating blood sugar, optimal brain functions, weight control, and even some immune system functionality.</p>
<p>Yes, but what has Fiber got to do with all of these?</p>
<p>Well, just like every other organism, there is a need for your bacteria to eat and earn survival energy to function well. Since most foods are absorbed into the bloodstream before they find their way into the large intestine, only little is left for the guts bacteria to feed on.</p>
<p>So, you see where fiber comes in handy! Normally, the human cells are unable to produce the enzyme that can process fibers, hence it is left untouched till it gets to the guts. Only then can the bacteria there has a swell time, processing them and making them function as prebiotics.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Fibers help in controlling excessive weight through a healthy diet</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you don’t know, fibers can be efficiently helpful when watching weight by ameliorating your appetite.</p>
<p>Certain studies put it that ingesting a good amount of dietary fiber can influence weight loss by naturally taking down the intake of calories.</p>
<p>Fiber actually soaks up water from the intestine by slowly absorbing the nutrients of the diet and giving a complete feeling of fullness. However, it depends on the kind of fiber involved.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Influences Blood Sugar Spikes</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Foods that contain a high amount of fiber have the potentials of having a lower glycemic index than their refined carb, off-fiber counterpart. Thus, it is more important to eat high-viscosity and soluble fibers.</p>
<p>With these forms of fiber, there are greater advantages that you’d amass the little number of sugar spikes and thereby reduce your chances of high blood pressure.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong>How about Constipation issues? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important considerable factor about the fiber is its capacity to reduce constipation. Generally, fiber absorbs water.  And as such, the bulk of your stool is soaked up and sped through your intestine with ease. However, there is a shred of more conflicting evidence to back up this claim.</p>
<p>While certain studies prove that the intake of fiber improves constipation symptoms, other studies have countered this claim by affirming that fiber reduces constipation. In actuality, both claims are correct. The effects are dependent on the kind of fiber being ingested.  Hence, it is important that you contact a health professional, preferably a nutritionist to put you through the kind of fiber that is best for you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you’re gunning to lead a healthy lifestyle and have a healthy diet, ensure that you eat adequate healthy foods such as grains, nuts, fruits and vegetables that contain adequate fiber. Be guided, your Health is your Wealth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business page is probably one of your most powerful tools at your disposal right now. But then, the blog might not be as efficient as it should. Why is this so? Well, the reasons are numerous but we won’t be focusing majorly on that. Rather, we will be discussing how to structure your business blog posts on your business blog to enable maximum conversion.</p>
<p>Quite tyrannical, is it? Don’t be too hard on yourself, we’ve got your back. With this article, you should be ready to roll in no time. Let’s begin.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structuring your business blog posts</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, there are certain elements that are key in every blog post and domain.  While some are easily noticeable, the others aren’t but altogether, they play an essential role in making or marring your life. Here’s what you should consider when structuring a blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary business page navigation</strong>: Regardless of whether the user isn’t checking out the business section of your blog, it a important that you make them learn about your business; the services you offer and the goods you sell. You can do this by including a simple navigation menu to the primary business page.</li>
<li><strong>Content grouping</strong>: Now that you have got guests on your platform, you should encourage them to stay. Ensure that they can browse through available content with ease by grouping the content, either by content, topic of skill level.</li>
<li><strong>Search box</strong>: Users should be able to look up for what they are exactly looking for by simply teaching for it. A simple search box on the side is enough for that.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">HOW TO FACILITATE A PROPER BOOK REVIEW </a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subscription options:</strong> Readers should be encouraged to follow up on the content on your blog. You’d do well by including a way to subscribe to your content either via RSS or email.</li>
<li><strong>Preview posts are important</strong>:  Most of the time, we tend to have scanners, then real viewers or readers. Allow them the opportunity to skim your contents by offering them preview posts. If you can, include a clickable image to draw in more attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, every one of your business blog posts should have five essential characteristics, including the content itself.   The elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call-to-Actions (CTAs):</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, this element is very essential for your blog post to make conversions. The more you dedicate to it, the more conversion you’re more likely to have. Of course, you don’t have any excuse not to have it. They are the essentiality on which your readers’ interest are developed. To the layman, CTAs aren’t really worth too much attention, after all it is just a button. Yes, this is right but trust me, the last thing you want to do now is to lose valuable conversions. You’d be killing the business even before it got started. However, there quite a lot of ways you can optimize your CTAs. You just have to look through what exactly will work for you. Once you’ve successfully done this, you are one step ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>: Hey, don’t be a boring host. Your blog post shouldn’t be all about“business-like” text. No, it might sound boring to some readers. Try including at least an image to spice up the readers psyche.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Quick load time</strong></h3>
<p>: As aforesaid, most online shoppers and readers are more scanners than readers. They don’t have the liberty of patience to wait for your page to load for lengthy periods. So, you should ensure that your business page doesn’t take more than three seconds before it can be accessed. If you can, a less than 2 seconds period is just good enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are done with structuring your page, let’s move on to the next important thing.</p>
<h2>          2.    SEO of your business blog posts</h2>
<p>Well, no blog content goes past without saying more than a “Hi” to this. Trust me, you need to be familiar with this.  While you’re aiming to reach your targeted audience, you should also consider search engine optimization.  You need as many inorganic guests as you need organic ones. After all, it is for the growth of your business. Here’s what you should do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporate your blog with the primary business page domain</strong>: Make sure to host your blog page within your fundamental domain rather than externally hosting your blog. This way, you wouldn’t have to murder the SEO administration by causing two domains to compete against themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A keyword-focused page title is essential</strong>&#8211; Rather than denoting your blog with “Company’s Blog”, you should consider the opportunity keyword optimization is offering you. Since search engines emphasize left-closed words, your blog&#8217;s page title should be named with something that is keyword-related before even including your company’s name. This way, you can actually lay proper claims for those keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-descriptions are equally great</strong> &#8211; These are more of a summary description of your search engines webpage. Ensure that your post contains this description, one of the obviously related keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t forget internal links:</strong> While you are navigating to other blog structure contents, you shouldn’t forget about linking relevant content from one post to another. Provide your reader with internally linked to other pages within your domain with relevant strategic caster text to enable better keyword ranking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve successfully integrated all of these, then you would have successfully given your blogpost a boost to rank better on SEO</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Social Media</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every business blog owner wants to share their content with every part of cyberspace. But the question is; how prepared are these contents for social media? Are they properly optimized? If not, then you need to go back and integrate steps 1 and 2 of this piece to your business webpage. Only then are you worthy of considering this phase. But how do you know whether or not your blog is rightly optimized? Well, we dealt with that in this piece.</p>
<p>First off, you have to optimize your blog  homepage and then follow these social tips.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Provide your guest with social subscription options in your business blog posts: </strong></h3>
<p>Give your readers the option to follow your blog on any social network they prefer. This would encourage better interaction on the social media, away from the blog itself.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Social proof display: </strong></h3>
<p>This is proof that your audience is motivated socially, not just by your blog posts. To achieve this, you have to ensure that there is social interaction on your blog. If you can, create a live-feed of how people are tweeting on your business social network handle.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it. Quite a lot of optimizing it is. But then, if you’re able to take the time to integrate every of the mentioned phases and sub-phases in this article, you are good to go. You don’t have to be a multi-billion dollar firm before you can reach out to the social network, you could run your business page right there where you’re sorted by creating unique business blog posts. You just have to get it right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world, our well-being is very important, too many ailments have been around like never before. We must advocate for our own health. You have to realize this &#8211; it is you, not your doctors are in charge of the quality of your medical care. They aren&#8217;t gods, and you are not a wuss. I hope you get this? Always strive to <strong>get the best medical care</strong>, you are entitled to it.</p>
<p>To be in charge of your medical care, and getting the best out of it, you need to do this first &#8211; shift your notion of doctors being some benevolent dictators. They are not, they are your employees. Just like you would expect from other businesses. So, demand good customer service from your doctors/hospitals.</p>
<p>In this article, you will read about some steps that can help you get the best medical care from your doctors and hospitals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Steps for getting the best medical care</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Always use schedules</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to make it a practice to update your appointments with your, dentist, doctor and other healthcare providers &#8211; be it on a paper calendar or a digital one. Some digital devices can also be used to alert you on upcoming appointments. Schedule appointments a week or two ahead using a reminder. Reschedules should also be updated. This will prevent you from missing appointments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Don&#8217;t be reactive, be proactive if you want best medical care</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To be a proactive patient, you do more than just walking into an examining room and waiting for your physician to fix you. You should be actively interested in getting the best healthcare &#8211; no matter what the sacrifice is needed to achieve this important goal.</p>
<p>You can also be more proactive by always keeping a journal available for questions and observations during your appointments. This will help you get the best out of your visit time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always speak up</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, you feel reluctant to speak to your doctor, believing that the symptoms would go gone on their own. Some of these issues can be symptoms &#8220;down there&#8221;. To get the best medical care out there, you must not be shy.</p>
<p>The fact is, doctors have seen and heard different kinds of complaints regarding symptoms or diseases. Don&#8217;t ever feel embarrassed. If it&#8217;s that serious, just speak up about it. Always open up to your doctors. They can&#8217;t help you if you don&#8217;t reveal what you are dealing with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always ask for medical records</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a smart move. No matter the condition of your medical issue, serious or just checkups, develop a habit of asking your physician for your medical records. And when you get them, always read them.</p>
<p>You still need the information within your health records, even though those records belong to your doctor. There might be little charges for those copies, but with the information in these reports, you have your health history at your fingertips &#8211; they are very useful in emergency issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Make sure you follow up</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you have a medical test, for example, go further by asking your doctor when to expect your test results. Write the date down and always follow up with your doctor&#8217;s office with calls, from time to time.</p>
<p>And no, you are not bothering them, it&#8217;s a priority for you, and you have absolute right to do so. Remember, he/she is your employee.</p>
<p>Lack of effective communication with your physician can cost you a lot. Always follow up for useful updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Use your basic instinct if you want the best medical care</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, some illnesses can be difficult for doctors to diagnose. They may tell you that you are fine and just give you certain prescriptions. A patient may find out that the treatment isn&#8217;t working. With time, your gut can give you more signs that you need more opinions for different diagnoses.</p>
<p>If you have confidence in your instincts, it can save you a lot of time. And this makes it easier for your physician to guide you. Pay attention, your gut always tells you something about your health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always be informed</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though physicians can&#8217;t know it all regarding our health, we still expect them to.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to wait till you are diagnosed with a critical illness before taking basic actions, always get informed.</p>
<p>You need to always push for answers when certain symptoms occur. Only you know your body best. Your doctor won&#8217;t always have all the answers to every disease.</p>
<p>Always ask important questions as to when needed and do personal research from reliable sources. Remember, it&#8217;s always your health, always be your own very best advocate.</p>
<p>With what was discussed above, you are on a sure way to <strong>getting the best medical care</strong>. Use these strategies and you will be in charge of your health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To get optimal results with your content you need to device a strategy. The strategy has to be one that your readers are familiar with, and are able to blend with any time. Meanwhile, it has to be one that gives you an edge over your competitors. But on a lighter note, churning out an efficient strategy isn’t as difficult as it sounds. Once done right, you’d definitely reap the benefits and become a great content writer. To begin with, you’d have to make some deep-down researches to get a clear vision of what you’re looking to accomplish as a great content writer. Once you’re able to define it, then it’s achievable.</p>
<p>So, in a bid to affirm that you don’t encounter many troubles developing a content strategy, we have taken the burden off from you to ensure that whatever the strategy you imbibe,  you’d have to do it right.</p>
<p>Highlighted below are five elements to drive you straight to your destination towards becoming a great content writer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Review your platform from a credible perspective</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ask yourself these questions. Why are you producing content exactly? What are your primary weakness and strengths? How much do you rank against your competitors? What are the opportunities you’re promoting via your platform? Also, what are the necessary inductions that you need to include in your platform to make it a masterpiece? The questions continue until you are able to become a great content writer. Just take the bulls by the horn and be completely honest.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>As a great content writer, you have to Determine your audience</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although this sounds quite simple and straightforward, if you are not able to recognize who your present and potentials audience(s) are, then you’re simply whistling into thin air.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve recognized your audience, you need to be double sure that your content aligns with the potentials they seek. Don’t assume that the same content hook you used for keeping them glued to your platform some years back is still as potent. Rather, you should expand your options to horizons that not only catch their fancy but also sell you out completely to your present and potential audience.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Goals are necessary as a great content writer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Like the popular age-long proverb says, “if wishes were horses, even beggars would ride.” Ironically, there is no success attached to mere wishes. You have to work for it. But then, you can’t go to battle without recognizing who or what your enemies are. Failure to do is equivalent to woeful failure itself.</p>
<p>That said, you can see the importance of setting goals, even when it concerns your content. More than just having a clue, you need to have a stable vision to affirm that you’re on the right track of achieving success.</p>
<p>Make a noble objective on how to achieve that goal, only then can you map out an efficient and effective strategy that works. You could run social media campaigns, email campaigns, cross-overs, and heavy platform presence. Failure to do this, well….. Don’t expect much to happen.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Cross-check your content and be double sure about your audience </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When last did you run sanitation on your email list or platform content? Are you still banking on deadwood materials to give you maximum, potent results? Have you tried including more sources or made extra researches to hook new audiences or better still, get your present ones to be more interested in your content? The truth is, you could boast of one of the best-written contents, but if you’re only attracting a little fraction of the audience you’re looking to explore on, what then is the point?</p>
<p>Take a good look at your content type. Are you honestly satisfied with what you see? Do you still run on the same style you started with, without spicing it up with some unusual “take-away” hooks? Believe it or not, “always normal” can be boring. You need more than just that to become a great content writer.  Always keep your content fresh and spicy, anything aside from this is simply a waste of time and resources!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Measure your success if you aspire to be a great content writer</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve successfully put everything in place, and running on a full-scale, goal-impaired system, then it is the right time to start to monitor how much you’ve amassed.  How much audience is your content able to pull? How well do you now rank against your competitors? Are your potential expectations falling in place? If the answers to these are not convincing enough, what are the obstructions?   How well and soon can you improve?</p>
<p>However, even if you’re doing well, good for you but it’s not time to relax, yet! Take time to see if you could even be better than you are now. Definitely, there are better alternatives for you. You only have to notice and then bank on them. Only then is your profitability assured!</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion </strong></h3>
<p>Finally, we’ve come to the end of the best elements you need to include in other to rank your content among the best. You’ll notice that for the most part, it is centered more on common sense, inculcated in an orderly manner. Your content is out right there in the digital world competing against lots of the same message and vision. Would you like it to languish behind while you could have done something about it? Of course not after reading this piece. You have to go in and ensure that you adopt these five elements to buttress your digital strategy. You’ll not regret doing it now. You will ripe the benefits in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you eyeing a particular keyword and looking to integrate it into your page? Or you probably want to see your website page ranking well on a search engine? Well, you’ve got to be prepared for it. The journey isn’t an easy one, but it is achievable.</p>
<p>As you already know, organic keyword ranking is a continuous process. Although you won’t get your desired results always, once you are able to commit to content optimization and marketing, then you can make things happen.</p>
<p>On this note, let’s delve into 10 steps to ranking a keyword optimally for your webpage.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>A formidable foundation for your page ranking</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Somehow, this is more of a pre-step before the actual step. You really have to put some basics in place before you can consider ranking for any keyword. Some of the things you need to do are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reputable platform –  How long a website has been around matters. More so, how much you’ve been able to accrue authority and links is the major key to launch SEO best practices.</li>
<li>Reliable network – To efficiently rank a keyword, your network is very much important. How much audience does your content draw? How much influence are you able to draw from social media? Is your email marketing bringing you the much-needed contacts? Once you’re able to create a credible network, then you’d have succeeded in building a worthy relationship for your page to rank well. It’s only the basics though and you have to take your time to do it right.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Research your initial keyword</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t assume you know your targeted keyword. It will kill your page. Rather, take the time to search the keywords while comparing and contrasting as many tools as possible.  Only then can you decipher the search volume for the keyword and competition abound before finalizing on your chosen keyword.  Here are some of the things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good volume is good enough – While you don’t want to go for a keyword with a relative search volume, you wouldn’t just have to settle for one that is very popular. That said, you should take time to study whether the high-ranking keyword has any relevance with your website and not too difficult to comprehend.</li>
<li>Go for related business model keywords – Your website is more likely to succeed in keyword ranking only if the chosen keyword is relevant to the platform.  Even with that, you have to ensure that the chosen keyword is valuable enough for any irrelevancy either for the page or the audience involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>To further help, you should compile a list of close variations on your primary keywords. They would enable you to make a choice and optimize your content.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Look out for possible competitors</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hurray! You finally decided on a keyword. But that not all. Take the time to search through and see how other related platforms as you are doing. Check out for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domains and URLs – Are there any high-ranking URLs with your chosen keyword? How many are precise match domains?</li>
<li>Titles – How does the title tag? Do they include the keyword?</li>
<li>The ranking content – Are they product reviews, blog posts or videos?</li>
<li>Types of businesses being ranked– Are they upcoming or big brands?</li>
<li>What are your competitors’ authoritative strengths?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although you’re looking out to stand uniquely-tall among your others, you, however, have to look out for how other competitors are doing to beat them to their game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/best-accounting-help/">Writing errands: For best accounting help.</a></h2>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>What are your intentions towards your page ranking? </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The specificity of the keyword gives it a better gauge for potential searchers to look out for. Apparently, the intent of the keyword is what prompts researchers’ accessibility. You need to understand that some researchers would rather go for a keyword of the search query they really want.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Envisage the Content</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next thing to do is map out the content that will actually help your rank. As you already know, there are lots of available options to help your keyword rank. Some of them include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog post</li>
<li>Product page</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>An index or directory of links</li>
<li>An authoritative guide, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, how long it will take you to create content as well as who’d create it is very important.  Do you have the budget and resources to run the content? Regardless of your resources, you possess the capacity to create content. While infographics and videos might cost you more, text articles and blogs would cost you less.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong>Execute </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>None of the aforementioned steps actualize unless they are executed. But more importantly, you don’t have to rush it. Take your time to make keyword researches and churn out worthy content that will sell it out.  Take note, it isn&#8217;t to have a search engine optimized content but with the right keyword and properly structured content, you’re set there.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong>Analyze properly if you want unique page ranking</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, now that you’ve launched your content with your fully-optimized keyword, you’re almost done. But not done yet.  The internet of space is a living means and it is never too late to optimize your content. Manually check how your keyword ranks ( there are lots of ranking tools available online) and make sure you’re not seeing personalized results. Utilize analytics to decode the keyword that your content is ranking for. They might be for initial content and not the original one you planned. Although this is a welcome development, it actually would be better if your plan goes accordingly. If it doesn’t go consequently as you wanted, then theirs is more work for you to do.</p>
<p>Here’s what to consider:</p>
<p>Is your keyword properly optimized for your page ranking?</p>
<p>Is it visible?</p>
<p>What else can you add to make it sell out?</p>
<p>Once you’re able to find solutions to the above questions, you are definitely going to begin seeing results soon enough.</p>
