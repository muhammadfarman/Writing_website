										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is the second-largest money transfer fintech company globally after Western Union. It offers a long and well-established record of services. Most people and experts would solidly recommend using MoneyGram any time and any day because of its comprehensive services.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company offers cheap rates for certain currencies and a well and long-established record of service and extensive coverage.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What are its fees and Exchange rates?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here&#8217;s the dropdown;</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Exchange Rate Margins:</span></em></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is known to apply the standard practice of taking a margin on the exchange rate. This means that the exchange rate offered to MoneyGram customers isn&#8217;t as good as the actual mid-market exchange rate. And MoneyGram profits from such a difference. Which is known as the exchange rate margin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram&#8217;s fees and exchange rates leave the service as the cheapest provider between countries. And according to analysis, MoneyGram was said to be the cheapest provider. That is, it took 1% of online searches across over half a million searches about sending and receiving money in Africa in September 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let&#8217;s use an example to make this discussion a bit simple for you. If you were in Los Angeles in the United States, and you desired to send about 1000 dollars to Beijing in China. You would have to pay about 58 dollars in total fees. And your beneficiary would receive about $942 if you decided to send via WorldRemit.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now, suppose you decided to still make the same transfer with MoneyGram, on the other hand. In that case, you&#8217;d pay a considerably high total fee of 78 dollars. And your beneficiary would be receiving $922. That&#8217;s more than a thousand yuan fewer than they&#8217;d receive if you&#8217;d sent with WorldRemit.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base Fees:</span></em></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MoneyGram fees vary, and that depends on the amount sent. Also, it depends on the transfer and receiving countries, and the payment and receiving methods. Here&#8217;s how you can save on fees with MoneyGram;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sending to a bank account is usually less expensive than sending money for cash pick-up.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;re sending money for cash-pickup, the online service will generally be cheaper than sending money at an agent location, and only if you make payments by bank transfer.</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When transferring in any kind online with MoneyGram, it would be best to pay by bank transfer if this would be available.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;re sending money to a bank account, it&#8217;s often more affordable to send at an agent location than online, and that&#8217;s regardless of the payment technique used. Still, the agent location fees can also vary a bit, and that&#8217;s depending on which location you do select.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is it easy to transfer money through MoneyGram?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Setting up your money transfer with MoneyGram was once more complex than it should&#8217;ve been, but nowadays, the service has been making fundamental progress in such regard.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The web design is also said to be uncluttered and straightforward, and that&#8217;s for example, it&#8217;s known to include a concise and relatively transparent breakdown of the fees you can expect to pay.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With all that said, MoneyGram&#8217;s website includes precise, valuable, and easy-to-access alternatives for those who wish to track their money and monitor, especially when received by the recipient, that&#8217;s providing a safe and accessible option, and only if you would like to keep an eye on your transfer.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Registering on MoneyGram; what it entails.</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most online service is said to be plain and simple, clear and easy instructions and even explanations. Nevertheless, we do have to put here that you&#8217;ll need to fill out various fields to sign up successfully and agree with terms and conditions you don&#8217;t have time to read.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Things that they will need from you are your home/billing address, birth date, mobile number.</span></p>
<h3><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There&#8217;s much credibility:</span></em></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MoneyGram is a giant multinational company that&#8217;s also publicly traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market with a whopping sum of over 200 million dollars of market capitalization in September 2020 alone.</span></li>

During this time, it&#8217;s been known to have gone through several collaborations and acquisitions and has demonstrated significant expertise in the Money transfer industry.</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">True to its reputation and scope, the extent of MoneyGram&#8217;s service cuts across the world, and it&#8217;s also quite impressive indeed, only matched by its competitor Western Union.</span></li>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It usually starts when the placenta has been delivered for six weeks or 42 days. Some of the organs may go back to the pregnant state in weeks or even in a month</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Important </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the puerperium</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The patient recovers from the labor, hence leaving her tired</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can&#8217;t proceed with this without explaining what Bitsika means. <strong>Bitsika</strong> is simply a remittance platform that utilizes cryptocurrencies and fiat money to send or deliver quick money transfers. It sends or delivers in Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, and more African countries within a specific transaction threshold.</p>
<p>Bitsika was launched in 2019. So far, the company has managed to process one million dollars&#8217; transaction on its platform in less than three months.</p>
<h2>How to make instant money transfer using Bitsika;</h2>
<p>First of all, you have to know the supported money payments for this platform. They are; credit or debit cards, mobile money, Bitcoin, and bank transfer.</p>
<p>Also, you can send money to just anyone who has the Bitsika app in supported countries by simply using their username. And the process is somewhat instant, and you can send as little as one cent. And the recipient receives the money in less than about five minutes.</p>
<h2>The signing-up process;</h2>
<p>First of all, you need to use your Gmail account to sign up for the Bitsika app. And Google takes such responsibility to manage your password and ensure your overall safety.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you&#8217;ll also need to download the app onto your phone, tablet, or any mobile internet-enabled gadget in particular. With that done, you&#8217;ll be assigned a username. It starts with the dollar encoded sign— $Martin, $Catherine, $Kate, etc. The Bitsika app is available on the Apple Store and the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>When you have your username, you&#8217;ll automatically have your account set up for you. There will be no further hassling procedures.</p>
<h2>Acting it</h2>
<p>$Martin in Nairobi desires to send money to $Kate in Cape Town. He makes a deposit of 200 dollars&#8217; credits on the Bitsika app through bank transfer or credit card. Then he proceeds by sending that 200 dollars to $Kate, all within the app. $Kate withdraws the money through mobile money. And the transaction is processed within three minutes in the maximum.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk about how you make a deposit using Bitsika;</h2>
<p>You can deposit cash on the application through various payment platforms such as debit cards or bank transfers. Each deposited amount is virtually exchanged into USDC currency, issued by Coinbase. It is preserved in the app as your balance. And, the good part about this is, the deposited amount never changes its value.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ll like to ask you this, do you know what USDC is?</h2>
<p>USDC is simply a stable coin backed by the United States currency or, simply put, US dollars. They are known to be held in reserve by regulated financial institutions. Regulated financial institutions also issue the tokens themselves. Also, every token can be redeemed for just 1$, and that&#8217;s providing a price-stable cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>How does $Kate make her withdrawal?</h2>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s simple. With Bitsika, you can decide to withdraw from the app to your bank account or another digital wallet such as mobile money.</p>
<p>And do you know that transferring money between countries happens with the help of crypto in the background? But you aren&#8217;t even aware of this, I guess? As they are fondly called, these USD credits are believed to be the best way the African market trader will access the USD without any form of hustle and toil. It&#8217;s also believed to be a great store of value for you. Yes, talking to you! and that&#8217;s if you want to hedge your assets from unstable currencies. Quite cheeky.</p>
<h2>This is what you’ll be expecting by making transactions with the Bitsika app;</h2>
<p>For just any transaction on Bitsika of up to three hundred dollars, there are no charges included! Neither does the service add a markup on the exchange rate. There&#8217;ll also be a small charge— just that small, and that&#8217;s after you cross the needed threshold.</p>
<p>In general, Bitsika is known to make its money from interest on fiat and crypto reserves. From such percentages, it charges on merchant API for businesses that desire to collect money from its users. It can be users from all over Africa and other parts of the world through Bitsika credits.</p>
<h2>Here are countries you can send or receive cash via Bitsika;</h2>
<p>As I said, at the moment, Bitsika permits its customers to send money to their friends and family in the following countries;</p>
<p>Mauritius, Gabon, Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana.</p>
<p>Here are the supported payment gateways;</p>
<p>Presently, the supported payment methods are Bank transfer (if you&#8217;re Nigerian), Mobile Money (Ghanaian), Bitcoin (worldwide), and Credit and Debit cards (worldwide).</p>
<p>Reasons on why you should use Bitsika apps to make transfers<strong>; </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Bitsika is known to be a multi-currency app. </em></li>
<li><em>You can also generate a virtual VISA card right on this app. Use it to pay on your favorite websites. For example, Netflix, Amazon, and everywhere virtual VISA card is accepted. </em></li>
<li><em>It does a KYC on you for security reasons; this means your transaction details are all safe. </em></li>
<li><em>You can also purchase airtime in Nigeria or Ghana— and that’s if you’re looking for the means to make a quick recharge. </em></li>
<li><em>Bitsika app is known to allow you to make money off the platform, and that&#8217;s by simply introducing and referring your friends. And you earn a 1-dollar referral for doing so. </em></li>
</ol>
<h2>What you can do with Bitsika;</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>It serves as a wallet. </em></li>
<li><em>As a form of social payment.</em></li>
<li><em>You can use it to create virtual cards. </em></li>
<li><em>Buy and sell BUSD. </em></li>
<li><em>Buy and sell bitcoin, etc. </em></li>
</ol>
<h2>Final Say</h2>
<p>Bitsika has entered and is seemingly penetrating Africa to reduce all costs of sending money, which is known to be the highest globally.</p>
<p>This fintech plans on becoming the leading money transfer in the continent, and that’s by simply using blockchain technology to save money and time in international money transfers.</p>
<p>In addition, it has also identified and solved the two major issues relating to Pan-African international transfers: rigorous and difficult modes of sending and receiving cash and pricing. The app also has the much-needed poise to spread to the rest of the continent in a short while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SHRM Versus HRM</strong></p>
<p>Organizations differ depending on their capabilities and resources. Regardless of the resources that a specific entity has, the concept of strategy plays a very essential role in company growth and expansion This is because it is through the strategy that organizations are capable of achieving sustainable or firm competitive advantage. The term strategy as applied in both corporate and human resource management goes beyond the aspect of competitive advantage. It, therefore, means specific, obtainable, and measurable plans that can be developed by company stakeholders. Here, these measurable plans could aim at linking the subordinates so that they can be in the position to achieve desired targets. Since the concept of strategy is wide, the research focuses on demonstrating its integration in human resource management.</p>
<p>Even though many people in societies confuse strategic human resource management (SHRM) with human resource management (HRM), the two phenomena are totally different. According to studies, SHRM refers to a management function that aligns human resource management practices, programmes, and polices with corporate strategies (Delery &amp; Roumpi, 2017). The core intention of this function is to ensure that organizations achieve their objectives without experiencing complexities. It does so by improving the entire business operations while maintaining organization culture. This culture can be associated with research, development, or innovation that could be of greater significance in enabling business enterprises to gain sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>There are various benefits that an organization can gain as a result of developing and implementing the managerial function of strategic human resource management. One of these benefits is related to job satisfaction. Just like customers in marketing management, employee needs and wants are catered by this management function. It is very hard for business operations to prosper when employees are not happy about remuneration and other employment benefits. SHRM exists to ensure that all issues related to employees are resolved towards maximum production. Therefore, employees will perform their responsibilities effectively since their satisfaction is of greater focus. Job and increased customer satisfaction are as a result of strategic human resource management. This means that customers and employees are valued as the cored resources that assist organizations in achieving maximum production.  Not only does SHRM is linked to organization production but also acts as an effective approach towards managing employees.</p>
<p>On the other side, human resource management (HRM) refers to the systematic way of managing employees or human resources. The article of <em>Fundamentals of Human Resource Management</em> also defines HRM is the practice that organizations develop and implements towards maximizing the manner at which employees perform (Noe et al., 2018). This is one of the strategies that business enterprises can adopt to become more productive and efficient. For instance, human resource management (HRM) has a wide variety of policies and principles that an entity can use in order to oversee the personnel. It is essential to demonstrate that this does not work in Isolation with organizational systems and policies. For this reason, HRM entails all the possible ways that can assist business enterprises in managing the skilled workforce.</p>
<p>There are several activities that are associated with the concept of human resource management (HRM).  Some of these human-oriented practices entail but are not limited to industrial relations, performance appraisal, recruiting, development and training, health as well as safety. If organizations can effectively consider these activities, then Stewart &amp; Brown (2019) argues that human resource practices and policies can be adjusted to facilitate corporate strategies. For organizations to adopt these effectively, there is a need for skilled manpower described as a human resource manager. This skilled professional is entitled to functions such as overseeing change, evaluation, managing employee relationships, monitoring, maintaining, developing, staffing, and planning.</p>
<p>Having clearly defined the meaning and importance of SHRM and HRM concepts, it is essential to highlight some of the key differences between the two. The core difference is based on the objective between SHRM and HRM. Strategic human resource management (SHRM) aims at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of employees towards enabling business enterprises to achieve their desired targets or goals. According to studies, some of the essential activities that can add value as long as SHRM is involved in organizational goals are employee retention, motivation, compensation, promotion, training, selection, and appraisal (Armstrong, 2016). On the other hand, HRM aims at employee compensation after an appropriate selection. This means that employees are entitled to employment benefits because of participating in organizational practices or operations.</p>
<p>Another difference between SHRM and HRM is related to governance and leadership. When it comes to strategic human resource management (SHRM), managers in all departments are coordinating employees and the operations they do. It is essential to demonstrate that this kind of governance is applicable to <em>all</em> managers who are involved in the daily operations of employees. These managers can be in strategic positions or any other department that is of greater significance in assisting the organizations in achieving organizational targets. In strategic HRM, the human resource manager acts as an imitator. This means that he or she is always seeking for the transformational category of leadership. On the other side of HRM, only the human resource department is responsible for employee coordination. When it comes to leadership, the human resource manager acts as a change follower. For this reason, he or she is capable of responding to changes through the transactional approach of leadership.</p>
<p>In addition, it becomes hard for the organization to prosper without appropriate strategies. Managers have to make vital decisions on matters regarding critical operations. The scope of decisions is another factor that can be used to differentiate strategic human resource management (SHRM) from human resource management (HRM). In SHRM, for instance, decisions related to the issues of employees are always proactive. Delery &amp; Roumpi, 2017) establishes that a proactive strategy of decision making allows human resource experts to anticipate core issues during employee training and staffing level. It is through effective anticipation that a human resource manager(s) can develop strategies for constant production. On the other side of HRM, decisions are reactive in nature. The reactive model, therefore, takes an immediate effect of responding to issues. This means that human resource issues are responded to as soon as they occur. If the organization experience low production as a result of poor employee training, for instance, then the human resource department utilizes its resources and efforts in developing effective solutions.</p>
<p>Organizations have different resources that are of greater significance when it comes to the attainment of goals. However, employees are termed as the core element that assists business enterprises in delivering their promises to customers. The manner at which employees are treated can be used as a dimension to demonstrate key differences between SHRM and HRM. Ideally, human resources are considered as a business partner in SHRM. Some studies believe argue that partnership does not only involve employers and employees but also as well (Bailey et al., 2018). Since human resources are perceived as internal customers in SHRM, they are handled with great care and respect. On the other side, the concept of human resource management considers human resources as &#8216;hired people or workers&#8217;. The consequences of this consideration are intense due to limited care and respect. Organizational performance seems to poor since there is no appropriate mechanism of motivation.</p>
<p>Just like the way the customer relationship management approach is used to maintain the relationships between customers and marketers, organizations may decide to adopt other approaches towards achieving sustainable performance and competitive advantage. However, the category of approach to be adopted depends on the type of concept implemented by the organization. For the managerial concept of SHRM to be successful, business enterprises ought to consider the integration approach. This approach aims at aligning the core business strategies with developed human resources practices for the organization. It is through effective alignment that corporate targets can be achieved without the organization facing challenges. On the other side of human resource management (HRM), business enterprises must follow the fragmentation approach. Here, the organization is forced to develop and implement management guidelines while overseeing human resources or employee.</p>
<p>In most cases, organizations fail in achieving corporate targets because of increased costs of operations. Not only does cost becomes the only factor that makes organizations lose their ambitions also a waste of resources and time. For instance, human resource managers waste a lot of time while supervising or controlling employees. The challenge of time wastage has been eliminated by the strategic human resource management function (SHRM). According to Armstrong (2016), it is through management guidelines or principles that human resource experts have eliminated the aspect of stringent control. The rationale behind the absence of stringent control is that rules associated with the management of manpower are lenient. While in human resource management (HRM), managers are exercise stringent control over the employees through supervision, monitoring, and other managerial activities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, organizations should always evaluate the capabilities and establish a strategic approach or function they develop and implement. If business enterprises agree to go with strategic human resource management (SHRM), then are several elements they should know. Such key elements entail a proactive style of decision making, integration approach, responsibility (departmental managers), employee treatment (business partner), no stringent control (management guidelines), and objective (efficiency and effectiveness of employees). On the other hand of human resource management (HRM), managers should consider critical elements like a reactive style of decision making, fragmentation approach, responsibility (human resource department), employee treatment (hired workers), presence of stringent control, and overall objective (employee compensation and selection).</p>

<h1><strong> COVID 19 IN EDUCATION SECTOR</strong></h1>
<p>coronavirus pandemic is a health crisis that  people are experiencing globally. It has posed a great challenge to the world as no cure has been found. This is due to its effects not only to the health sector but also to the socio-economic sectors. Most countries have decided and taken actions to alleviate the growth and development of a full-blown pandemic. Therefore countries have gone into localized closures. Schools, universities and all education systems have been closed down. As they can be a faster means of spreading the virus. This has resulted in home-schooling especially in countries that have been heavily affected. Countries such as Italy, Iran, and Korea. These changes in the education system have brought about inconveniences. However, innovation and invention within the sector get promption. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting influence on learning and its activities.</p>
<h3><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Growth in public-private educational partnerships</strong></a></h3>
<p>Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, there will be growth in public-private education partnerships. Different stakeholders within the education sector are on the lookout for solutions. In some countries, students engage in homeschooling. Where interactive applications is in use to enhance it. Others are using live television broadcasts. Where all learning materials are being made available. While in some, less innovative solutions are being implemented. Such as the use of Google Classroom where face to face instructions are given. All these solutions have assisted in keeping students busy while at home. Through the concept of digitization in education, learning anywhere, anytime might be the new trend in the education system.</p>
<p>The digital platforms that are being used are a result of combined efforts by learning coalitions and stakeholders. The stakeholders such as the government, education professionals, technology providers, and network providers. Through this education has received more attention. Going beyond the projects that are being funded by the government and non-profit social projects. Private organizations such as Microsoft and Google have developed a great interest and are investing in innovative education solutions. Both the private sector and government are arising to the authority of educated people. However, due to the pandemic, there is a limit on the carrying out of initiatives. However, it is evident that after the pandemic large-scale and cross-industry partnerships would be established. Involving the private and public sector with a common goal of providing education in the most convenient way.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/"><strong>Effects of the partnerships</strong></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/annual-report/mobilizing-partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth of these partnerships has begun</a>. For example in China, the Ministry of Education has assembled diverse parties. Who have contributed to the development of a new cloud-based, online learning and broadcasting platform.  This has led also to the upgrading of the education infrastructure in China. Which has been led by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and other stakeholders. Also, in Hong Kong a readtogether platform has been developed. It is an association with over 60 education organizations, the media, professions in the entertainment industry, and publishers.  Through this platform, educational resources and materials are provided. Materials such as assessment tools, book chapters, videos, and free counseling services.  The association aims and making use and upholding the platform in the future even after the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The development of these partnerships will be a trend. This is especially in countries where the government has been predominantly providing education. However, policies and regulations will need to be put in place. They will contribute to the execution and implementation of common goals. This will provide a clear guideline of how the partnerships will work, the contribution of each party, how decisions will be made.  In these, a code of conduct is emphasizes, ways of handling and managing conflict and ways of reaching a consensus in the case of disagreements. This ensures equity and fairness for both the private and public sectors.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits to the education system </strong></h3>
<p>This will greatly boost the education system leading to an educated populace. Through this, some of the major issues get solution over time. Issues such as unemployment, poverty, and underdevelopment. Education equips the population with the required skills, knowledge, and expertise in different professions. Through which people can seek employment, create employment opportunities, and come up with inventions and innovations within different sectors. Thus a majority of a country&#8217;s population engage in economic activities.</p>
<p>That enable them to earn a living. Therefore leading to high standards of life and reduced levels of poverty. Innovations and inventions are a major source of attraction to foreign investors. Therefore, boosting the economy of countries. The partnerships within the education sector may prompt partnerships in other sectors. Sectors such as the health sector, hospitality, and food sector among others. This brings about unity, equity, cooperation and effective use of resources. As the different sectors of a country’s economy are focusing on common goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>In conclusion, The COVID 19 pandemic has brought about inconveniences. However it is also prompting changes whose effects will be of benefit. Therefore as we find temporary solutions  to the problems arising, it is also important to look into permanent solutions for some of these issues. The COVID 19 pandemic has brought about a change in different sectors. It is therefore a primary responsibility and obligation to the world population to swiftly adapt. Adapting to the new changes and develop mechanisms. Which encourage growth and development. Therefore development despite the effects of the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing is the ultimate link that connects customers to your product. However, the supreme driver of these links to your product is the product marketing manager (PMM), the individual that knows your actual customers.</p>
<p>In truth, as a product marketing manager, you’re on the verge of growing your company by connecting customers to your product.  But then, it is not as easy as it sounds. Nevertheless, we have summed a comprehensive guide to help you properly implement a working strategy that works for your product marketing.</p>
<p>But one quick question pops to mind.</p>
<h3>How are product management and product marketing related?</h3>
<p>Well, you probably might have seen the term “product management” often used on business blogs and mostly used to refer to marketing. Now you’re at a crossroad to know whether they mean the same thing or not.?</p>
<p>Actually, you’re not alone. A lot of people, even business enthusiasts often confuse product marketing with product management.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>While product marketing often falls under the jurisdiction of a marketing department team to engage customers to buy directly from the company, product management, on the other hand, covers every purview about the product’s entire cycle from its manufacturer to sale and even more to the final consumer. Click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/marketing-sales/marketing-promotion/marketing-basics/seven-ps-marketing&amp;ved=2ahUKEwisvrPV_rHnAhXRQkEAHdrkCHUQFjAMegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MIVjo8zSuA7AVNpz12Vzo&amp;cshid=1580617774561">here</a> if you’d like to have deeper, in-depth knowledge about the 7 P&#8217;s of product marketing strategy</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding the 7 P&#8217;s of Product Marketing Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Professional product marketers often refer to some precepts while dealing with business. These precepts are the basis on which strategies are built.  To the non-initiate, it is simply the “Seven Ps” of marketing, but to kick-ass marketers, it is the seven pillars of commerce.  Let’s delve deeper to see the reason behind this notion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Product</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin with, you cannot go into marketing without having a specific product or products in mind. Meanwhile, your products might span across different things depending on the kind of company you operate on.</p>
<p>However, regardless of the product, you’re into, you stand a better chance of leveraging your product by integrating the seven Ps for better sales. More importantly, you stand a better chance when you know the product you’re dealing with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next on our list of seven Ps is pricing. It is important to know that you just cannot fail to consider pricing when you already have your product. Even if you don’t have many competitions, you have to consider pricing in such a way that your customers are overly considered and they can be influenced overly to patronize you.</p>
<p>At this point, it is just more than setting a price tag on a product and expects your customers to pay. No, it goes way beyond that. This time, you have to overly consider whether or not the general market ecosystem satisfies with your product and the subsequent pricing. Here, you’ve got to answer wavering questions like &#8211; How much is my product overly in demand? How well does my pricing fit into my potential customers&#8217; budget? Do I have people selling the same products, if yes, what’s their pricing like? These and many other questions are the questions that should ravage through your mind as you set your pricing for your product.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Place</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To the laymen, place refers solely to the location as far as product marketing is concerned, but then it goes way beyond that. Actually, they refer to the distribution strategy you have out in place to get your product across to your customers.  It refers to the channel put in place to make sure that once your product is already known, and your price set, you can get to your specific customers without any hassles. That way, you have them coming back to patronize your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every of the seven Ps in product marketing is important but then, we must pay close attention to the fourth P, Promotion.</p>
<p>More than just advertising, promotion goes deeper as to how your product is presented to the outside world. Does your product sit well in the mind of the consumers when it is been advertise? How much of a solid influence does your product have? How many customers seeing your ad are more willing to take the step to patronize you? These and many other questions are what make up your promotion. Although it is advertising, it is however basically on another level entirely. This time, it covers brand awareness, lead acquisition, demand generation, product differentiation as well as product messaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Process</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The product marketing process is the absoluteness that links the product marketing campaign to their major consumers. Simply put, the process in product marketing refers to the “conditions” put in place by the project team/ manager for customers to complete before getting a product.  This time around, it encompasses the other four Ps – the Product, Pricing, Place And Promotion. Hence, it makes way more easy to know who your real customers are and help you devise a method to keep them glued to you while you source for more patronage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>People</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, other Ps are useless without this P. Don’t get it all wrong. Other P&#8217;s are just as important as each other. but then, without people, then theirs is no market. You have this P happening straight from the production chain of delivery to the very last P of physical evidence. People are needed to make up the team that would deliver the product. You need people with quality and skills that can help make the product a success, even in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>Also, people are needed in distributing your product to the right consumers. People are needed to advertise your business. You need people to consume your product. In short, your product needs people to fully the right pricing. Of course, the sole reason your marketing team is working so hard is basically because of making sales. So, it is close to impossible to refuse not to be concerned about people when dealing with marketing. They are the bedrock to determine whether you’ll advance in the commerce spree or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Physical evidence</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find read the sixth P, about people, then you probably know we will be addressing “Physical Evidence” as our final P.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, there have been growing concerns about Erectile Dysfunction in young men. Lots of people have had one thing or more to say about it. Some have talked about how dysfunction negatively impacts their lives or people close to them. Thus prompting the thoughts of whether or not this dysfunction is a thing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ED is expected to happen in more men who are more advanced innate than their younger counterparts. But then, medical statistics have proven that quite a lot of young men in their prime report problems about erectile dysfunction. And this situation has left us wondering why such is the case.</p>
<p>The research of ED in men uses an age-bracket of 40 for determining the cut-off point for the term “young.” This arbitrarily constructs that the male folks within the teenage age of 18-40 are considered young. Unless otherwise specified, we&#8217;ll be referring to them as such from this article henceforth.</p>
<h2>How Common Do Young Men Experience Erectile Dysfunction?</h2>
<p>As opposed to initial medical studies from the World Health Organization journal on Erectile dysfunction in young men. The number of affected persons has drastically risen than it used to be. Reports show that more than 26% of men who undertake ED treatment are below 40 years of age.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/dealing-and-avoiding-kidney-stones/">Dealing and Avoiding Kidney Stones</a></h2>
<p>From every indication, this picture is quite worrisome. This is telling us that more than we expect. It means that the number of affected young men suffering from ED is on the rise.  And there’s a need for us to deal with this problem before it eats deeper than it has already done. How do we go about this? We&#8217;d discuss that soon enough. But first, we have to deal with the factors that relate to ED in younger men.</p>
<h2>Causes of Erectile Dysfunction in Younger Men</h2>
<p>According to extensive researches carried out about young people with erectile dysfunction. There are lots of suggestions indicating that the same factors resulting in ED in older can constitute the same problem for the younger ones. Some considered examples include depression, anxiety, partner-related emotions, and lack of sexual stimuli or attraction toward the opposite sex. These are liable to cause psychological imbalance. It can result in dysfunction while physical symptoms related to hormones, cardiovascular, and metabolic functioning can also result in a more incremental, adverse impact for any man, irrespective of the age.</p>
<p>Let’s go into details. Outlined below are some of the factors that could lead to ED in younger men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Physical Factors</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is one factor we just can not do without mentioning first.  What we eat, drink and generally ingest have the potentials to make or mar us. So then, it isn’t a surprise this is taking the lead in our list of factors leading to ED in young men.</p>
<p>In a bid to explore how consumables cause ED in younger men, medical authors of Sexual Medicine journals revealed that a good number of men with ED were the ones that weren’t wary of the food and things they ingest. The study proved that young men that partied in taking unhealthy foods and drinks which includes alcohol and cigarettes are at the risk of getting ED than their counterparts that ate healthy consumables.</p>
<p>Other physical factors worthy of consideration include lack of adequate exercise, stress, and lack of personal hygiene. Most men who don’t participate in taking exercises frequently, or are overly stressed out after work or any activity are more likely to have ED owing that they don’t have the physical fortitude to maintain an erection. Also, poor personal hygiene from either the person involved or their partners can negatively influence the sexual life of younger men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Psychological Factors</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next part we&#8217;d be discussing is the mental causes of ED in younger men. Usually, this factor isn’t always considered owing that the patients involved didn’t take full consideration of it.</p>
<p>The truth is, once the psychological balance over sex isn’t properly regulated, the grit to perform sexually is depleted to minimal. Simply put, a depressed, overly anxious man will underperform sexually.</p>
<p>Although this researches might be kind of spontaneous, there’s a strong medical suggestion that young men&#8217;s intuitions of their genitals and how to manage sexual psychology can help foster sexual performance. This can positively impact ED in younger men than ever before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone suddenly falls on the floor, his breath is palpitating quickly, your guess the person is trying to catch his breath by all means. What would you do at this moment? Would you scream for help or would you just stand there numb? Perhaps you have no idea what to do. Well if you see such, anytime and any day then you’ve just seen someone who is having a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Here are the signs, especially if you suspect a loved one of yours;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unable to respond</strong>: The person is unable to respond even if you tap him or her so hard on the shoulders. Or if you scream his name, he’s unable to hear you. There’s absolutely no reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Increased palpitation</strong>: the person is either breathing fast, gasping for air, or not breathing at all; then here is time to act.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Act Quickly as it might be a cardiac arrest</h2>
<p>If you have tried all means physically, like; slapping, hitting and yelling the person’s name and he or she refuses to respond. Then there is a great tendency he or she is suffering from a cardiac arrest. Here’s what to do at such a moment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If people are around you or you’ve got neighbors, please scream for help immediately</strong>: Tell someone nearby to call the emergency care line and ask a person or another to bring an AED (automated external defibrillator), and that’s if there’s any presently. Everyone around you, especially YOU would need to be quick in response because time is of the essence at this moment. And if you’re alone and suspect the person you’re with has signs of cardiac arrest, then you’ll have to call the emergency care unit at once and get an AED if you have one at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-physical-therapy/">What you need to know about physical therapy</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observe rhythmic breathing</strong>: if the person is either gasping or not breathing at all, then administer a CPR quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Use an AED NOW:</strong> use this device as soon as it arrives. Turn it on and follow the instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Give a quick CPR</strong>: place your palm above each other (make sure both palms are together in the form of a fist) on his or her chest and push down at least 2 inches at a rate of 101 to 121 pushes a minute or two. Make sure is in the center of the chest and allow the chest to come back to its normal position after each soft press.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t give up, PLEASE</strong>: Continue with the CPR, until you see the person either move or breathe again or until a person with more advanced knowledge or training takes over from you, for example, an emergency response team member or EMS team member.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Here’s why you should learn CPR</h2>
<p>There is a high call for people to learn CPR, and that’s because the survival rates for victims with cardiac arrest is still worryingly low.</p>
<p>It is estimated that less than one in ten people survive a cardiac arrest, this is a shock to all medical personnel. You may want to ask why? Here’s why, the solution to this surprisingly sudden problem, is at the same time surprisingly easy. And that’s simply applying a simple CPR on the victim.</p>
<p>Every minute that passes by without the application of CPR can reduce the victim’s chance of ever surviving a cardiac arrest by around 10%.</p>
<p>So in essence, if CPR is taught to people, it could help save hundreds, even thousands of lives annually.</p>
<p>“We wish all young men and women feel confident and willing to help when faced with a first aid emergency, “said Joe Mulligan, head of first aid education at the British Red Cross.</p>
<h2>Learning First Aid treatment of Cardiac Arrest</h2>
<p>First of all, you have to know that learning first aid definitely helps to increase a person’s confidence, and we believe it’s a life skill and a necessity that everyone should have or apply.</p>
<p>Now it comes down to you the reader, you should have the opportunity to learn first aid throughout your life, if fortunately, beginning from your school, so that generations of people can be equipped with the skill or training they need to help when there is a need for a quick response or in an emergency.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of free teaching resources on paper and online, not to forget workshops; if you wish to make it practical. Most of these workshops are designed to give young people the confidence, willingness, and the skill to act in times of emergency.</p>
<p>According to Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director for NHS, England. He said, “When one in five people witness someone fainting and who clearly needs CPR. The majority of people have no idea what to do at such a moment.”</p>
<p>This shows that teaching CPR to school children equips them with the needed knowledge, that’ll help them to act in times of need. It breeds confident youngsters in the society, also allowing them to be the hero for the moment. And that can be thrilling to them.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>To sum it all up, there needs to be mandatory training for all young and old people. Mostly, in the skill of administering CPR to victims of cardiac arrest. This surely would improve the rate of survival.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows how dangerous an asthma attack is. It is as dangerous as death itself. To combat this, most asthmatics rely on inhalers as the medication for managing their symptoms when they are under attack. So far, it has proven to be extensively effective.</p>
<p>For healthy reasons, asthmatic patients have had a cause to always keep their inhaler within reach. But then, they are humans as well and are prone to have situations when the inhaler isn’t within grasp.</p>
<p>During this moment, it can be quite hazardous for the patient to manage through if the attack hits in. They&#8217;d find it extremely distressing to control and if not properly handled, it can result in more complex complications.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some nonmedical means to help regulate breathing until the patient is able to access their medication. How? We&#8217;ll be discussing that in this article.</p>
<p>First off, it’d be great if we started off with explaining what asthma means.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Asthma?</strong></h2>
<p>Asthma is a health condition whereby the airway is thinned, swell and produce extra mucus. Once it hits, breathing becomes more difficult, coughing is triggered as well as wheezing and breath shortness.</p>
<p>Asthmatic attacks don’t just happen. They are usually triggered by varieties of things which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroach Waste</li>
<li>Dust</li>
<li>Indoor and outdoor mold</li>
<li>Pollen,</li>
<li>Pet dander.</li>
<li>Weather change – Quite interesting, weather changes can cause asthmatic attacks.</li>
<li>Air pollution: Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, smoke, paint fumes, and diesel particles as well as other cleaning products have the capacity to trigger asthma.</li>
<li>Tobacco smoke.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/what-we-should-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/">What we should know about the new coronavirus</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Stress and Anxiety</li>
<li>Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have the capacity to trigger 5% of adult asthma patients.</li>
<li>Yelling, Laughing, Crying, Exercises and other activities that affect breathing can trigger asthma.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Managing Asthmatic Conditions</strong></h2>
<p>As aforementioned, there are some simple non-pharmaceutical tricks to manage asthma.</p>
<p>However, in the case that you experience any of the following symptoms, you’d do well by seeking emergency medical assistance as swiftly as you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty in breathing properly or stopped breathing.</li>
<li>Rapid pulse</li>
<li>Severe Anxiety</li>
<li>Bluish color to the lips and face, called cyanosis</li>
<li>Sweating profusely.</li>
<li>Reduced level of consciousness, such as somnolence or confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to deal with a mild asthmatic attack without an inhaler </strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Sit Upright</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you don’t have any business lying down or hunching over. Else, you risk having a restricted flow of air from and to your lungs. Rather, sit uprightly with your back straight. This way, your lungs will be kept open and more amount of air can flow through your respiratory systems.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Take Quick, Deep Breaths</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When under attack, your heart rate tends to be marginally unbalanced and this isn’t good for you. So, take in breaths to help control your heartbeat and free off any tension you have in your chest. Sit upwards and inhale deep, belly breaths through your nose and exhale through it through your mouth.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Remain as calm as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an asthmatic patient, you have to do away with every form of stress and anxiety as it tends to trigger or even worsen asthmatic attacks. Stay composed by taking deep breaths, and visualize what your next action should be.  You stand a better chance if you have someone with you to comfort you to be at peace. This would help bring down the attack.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Keep your nutrients around </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Having certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C and magnesium, is a good way of managing asthma symptoms. Due to the bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects of magnesium, medical practitioners encourage it to be used as adjuvant therapy for child asthmatics. Some medical studies even claim that adequate usage of vitamin C has the capacity to drastically reduce exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Avoid Asthma Triggers as much as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, you already know this but then, you might be able to control this when you’re under attack. Try everything your capacity to get away from possible triggers without you having to over-exert yourself. Be open to asking for help if you’re unable to get it done by yourself.  Try as much as you can and get to a  more filtered, temperature-controlled air and shade area.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Coffee is good</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Medical practitioners have over the years discovered that caffeine has the capacity to modestly improve airways function as much as four hours. This also offers to people without asthma. Actually, Caffeine metabolizes into theophylline that aids in dealing with and preventing asthma while relaxing the airway. Be careful with this as it does have the potential of speeding up your heart rate which can result in hyperventilating.  A cup or two is enough to keep you stable. Read more about it <a href="https://www.drugs.com/cg/hyperventilation-discharge-care.html">here</a></p>
<h3><strong>Bottom line</strong></h3>
<p>Asthma can be life-threatening especially when it has done beyond being mild to more severe symptoms. Hence, it is advisable that you keep your inhaler with you always. Also, you’d have to be around friends and people that understand your health condition so that they can help rejuvenate you when you pass out, have breathing problems or begin to hyperventilate. Remember, you might not be able to do each of these things yourself, you need people to help you out.</p>
