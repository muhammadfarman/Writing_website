										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the name implies, this is simply the vast array of treatments that fall outside conventional treatments. Some have been tested and approved, while others have not, although there are various terms used to indicate “Alternative medicine. Like “integrative medicine” and “complementary healthcare.” All these names or terms refer to something different. I’ll like to brush on these terms before we delve much further into the topic.</p>
<h2>Complementary Health-care</h2>
<p>It simply refers to mainstream treatments used in conjunction with alternative treatments. For example, applying acupuncture in conjunction with the treatment of arthritis of the knee cap. This form of treatment has also been endorsed by the health regulatory boards of most countries.</p>
<h2>Alternative medicine</h2>
<p>It is simply using the non-conventional method of treatment-holistically replacing the westernized method of treatment. The methods used are yoga, acupuncture, herbal medicines, and massage.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/roles-of-school-nurses-in-healthcare-development/">Roles of School Nurses in healthcare development</a></h2>
<h2>Integrative Health-care</h2>
<p>It brings the non-conventional approach of treatment with the conventional method of treatment, thereby fusing it to cure an ailment or a sickness.</p>
<h2>Here are the Benefits</h2>
<p>According to reports of NCCAM (National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine), it has been reported that about 40% of adults and 15% of children in the United States use some kind of alternative medicine to treat themselves. And here are why they can’t stop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They receive the needed attention</strong>: Practitioners of Alternative medicine give their patients the required attention. It’s no surprise that when you go to these companies, you see people packed in large rooms, all for what? To spoil themselves with the personal attention they receive from these practitioners. And the fees are quite cheap or accommodating, highly different from the expensive conventional methods.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore the malady and concentrating on the patient</strong>: Based on their philosophy, these practitioners view any kind of disease as a separate entity from the person carrying it, and most form of this treatment, specializes on whole-body treatment. They also address the spiritual and emotional health of their patients, rather than specifically concentrating on the sickness on the patient’s body.</li>
<li><strong>There is a general focus on prevention</strong>: This is another advantage that has also been wholly applied to the conventional type of treatment. Ever heard the saying “prevention is better than a cure.” Well, these practitioners are known to use this knowledge or phrase as a basic instruction manual in treating their patients. They very well know how to work on the body to keep it fit and vitalized.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Disadvantages</h2>
<p>Before applying this method of treatment, you’ll have to know somethings. But this does not prevent you from still using this method, for they’re still highly recommended and safe;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited scope in research</strong>: There is still a lack of evidence in research to support the claims that this non-conventional treatment procedure works. The evidence is so limited, which has left many questions to be unanswered. Although currently, the scientist is still giving their best to find out the process of the systemic cures this treatment possesses most times.</li>
<li><strong>Dangerous side-effects and interactions</strong>: Although, most of these drugs are natural and contain no artificial substances, It is still harmful. It could pose a threat to health in some particular individuals, especially to those who might be allergic to certain plants or methods of treatment. You do not forget the side-effects of some of these natural products.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed-up information on publicity</strong>: There is a growing trend on the mix-up of these words “safe” and “natural.” Most health practitioners unknowingly mix them up, but they aren’t saying the same thing at all. So be very careful about the dietary supplements or herbal remedies you buy in the market. It is usually done to keep you safe generally.</li>
</ul>
<p>So to sum it all up, when choosing alternative medicine, make sure to think only in the aspect of balance. Know your body and gradually give your body the treatment it deserves, till it becomes accustomed to such treatments.
