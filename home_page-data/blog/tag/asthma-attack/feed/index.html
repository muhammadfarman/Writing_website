										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows how dangerous an asthma attack is. It is as dangerous as death itself. To combat this, most asthmatics rely on inhalers as the medication for managing their symptoms when they are under attack. So far, it has proven to be extensively effective.</p>
<p>For healthy reasons, asthmatic patients have had a cause to always keep their inhaler within reach. But then, they are humans as well and are prone to have situations when the inhaler isn’t within grasp.</p>
<p>During this moment, it can be quite hazardous for the patient to manage through if the attack hits in. They&#8217;d find it extremely distressing to control and if not properly handled, it can result in more complex complications.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some nonmedical means to help regulate breathing until the patient is able to access their medication. How? We&#8217;ll be discussing that in this article.</p>
<p>First off, it’d be great if we started off with explaining what asthma means.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Asthma?</strong></h2>
<p>Asthma is a health condition whereby the airway is thinned, swell and produce extra mucus. Once it hits, breathing becomes more difficult, coughing is triggered as well as wheezing and breath shortness.</p>
<p>Asthmatic attacks don’t just happen. They are usually triggered by varieties of things which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cockroach Waste</li>
<li>Dust</li>
<li>Indoor and outdoor mold</li>
<li>Pollen,</li>
<li>Pet dander.</li>
<li>Weather change – Quite interesting, weather changes can cause asthmatic attacks.</li>
<li>Air pollution: Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, smoke, paint fumes, and diesel particles as well as other cleaning products have the capacity to trigger asthma.</li>
<li>Tobacco smoke.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/what-we-should-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/">What we should know about the new coronavirus</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Stress and Anxiety</li>
<li>Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have the capacity to trigger 5% of adult asthma patients.</li>
<li>Yelling, Laughing, Crying, Exercises and other activities that affect breathing can trigger asthma.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Managing Asthmatic Conditions</strong></h2>
<p>As aforementioned, there are some simple non-pharmaceutical tricks to manage asthma.</p>
<p>However, in the case that you experience any of the following symptoms, you’d do well by seeking emergency medical assistance as swiftly as you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty in breathing properly or stopped breathing.</li>
<li>Rapid pulse</li>
<li>Severe Anxiety</li>
<li>Bluish color to the lips and face, called cyanosis</li>
<li>Sweating profusely.</li>
<li>Reduced level of consciousness, such as somnolence or confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to deal with a mild asthmatic attack without an inhaler </strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Sit Upright</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you don’t have any business lying down or hunching over. Else, you risk having a restricted flow of air from and to your lungs. Rather, sit uprightly with your back straight. This way, your lungs will be kept open and more amount of air can flow through your respiratory systems.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Take Quick, Deep Breaths</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When under attack, your heart rate tends to be marginally unbalanced and this isn’t good for you. So, take in breaths to help control your heartbeat and free off any tension you have in your chest. Sit upwards and inhale deep, belly breaths through your nose and exhale through it through your mouth.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Remain as calm as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an asthmatic patient, you have to do away with every form of stress and anxiety as it tends to trigger or even worsen asthmatic attacks. Stay composed by taking deep breaths, and visualize what your next action should be.  You stand a better chance if you have someone with you to comfort you to be at peace. This would help bring down the attack.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Keep your nutrients around </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Having certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C and magnesium, is a good way of managing asthma symptoms. Due to the bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects of magnesium, medical practitioners encourage it to be used as adjuvant therapy for child asthmatics. Some medical studies even claim that adequate usage of vitamin C has the capacity to drastically reduce exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Avoid Asthma Triggers as much as you can</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, you already know this but then, you might be able to control this when you’re under attack. Try everything your capacity to get away from possible triggers without you having to over-exert yourself. Be open to asking for help if you’re unable to get it done by yourself.  Try as much as you can and get to a  more filtered, temperature-controlled air and shade area.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Coffee is good</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Medical practitioners have over the years discovered that caffeine has the capacity to modestly improve airways function as much as four hours. This also offers to people without asthma. Actually, Caffeine metabolizes into theophylline that aids in dealing with and preventing asthma while relaxing the airway. Be careful with this as it does have the potential of speeding up your heart rate which can result in hyperventilating.  A cup or two is enough to keep you stable.

<h3><strong>Bottom line</strong></h3>
<p>Asthma can be life-threatening especially when it has done beyond being mild to more severe symptoms. Hence, it is advisable that you keep your inhaler with you always. Also, you’d have to be around friends and people that understand your health condition so that they can help rejuvenate you when you pass out, have breathing problems or begin to hyperventilate. Remember, you might not be able to do each of these things yourself, you need people to help you out.</p>
