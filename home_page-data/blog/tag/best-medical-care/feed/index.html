										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world, our well-being is very important, too many ailments have been around like never before. We must advocate for our own health. You have to realize this &#8211; it is you, not your doctors are in charge of the quality of your medical care. They aren&#8217;t gods, and you are not a wuss. I hope you get this? Always strive to <strong>get the best medical care</strong>, you are entitled to it.</p>
<p>To be in charge of your medical care, and getting the best out of it, you need to do this first &#8211; shift your notion of doctors being some benevolent dictators. They are not, they are your employees. Just like you would expect from other businesses. So, demand good customer service from your doctors/hospitals.</p>
<p>In this article, you will read about some steps that can help you get the best medical care from your doctors and hospitals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Steps for getting the best medical care</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Always use schedules</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to make it a practice to update your appointments with your, dentist, doctor and other healthcare providers &#8211; be it on a paper calendar or a digital one. Some digital devices can also be used to alert you on upcoming appointments. Schedule appointments a week or two ahead using a reminder. Reschedules should also be updated. This will prevent you from missing appointments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Don&#8217;t be reactive, be proactive if you want best medical care</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To be a proactive patient, you do more than just walking into an examining room and waiting for your physician to fix you. You should be actively interested in getting the best healthcare &#8211; no matter what the sacrifice is needed to achieve this important goal.</p>
<p>You can also be more proactive by always keeping a journal available for questions and observations during your appointments. This will help you get the best out of your visit time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always speak up</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, you feel reluctant to speak to your doctor, believing that the symptoms would go gone on their own. Some of these issues can be symptoms &#8220;down there&#8221;. To get the best medical care out there, you must not be shy.</p>
<p>The fact is, doctors have seen and heard different kinds of complaints regarding symptoms or diseases. Don&#8217;t ever feel embarrassed. If it&#8217;s that serious, just speak up about it. Always open up to your doctors. They can&#8217;t help you if you don&#8217;t reveal what you are dealing with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always ask for medical records</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a smart move. No matter the condition of your medical issue, serious or just checkups, develop a habit of asking your physician for your medical records. And when you get them, always read them.</p>
<p>You still need the information within your health records, even though those records belong to your doctor. There might be little charges for those copies, but with the information in these reports, you have your health history at your fingertips &#8211; they are very useful in emergency issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Make sure you follow up</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you have a medical test, for example, go further by asking your doctor when to expect your test results. Write the date down and always follow up with your doctor&#8217;s office with calls, from time to time.</p>
<p>And no, you are not bothering them, it&#8217;s a priority for you, and you have absolute right to do so. Remember, he/she is your employee.</p>
<p>Lack of effective communication with your physician can cost you a lot. Always follow up for useful updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Use your basic instinct if you want the best medical care</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, some illnesses can be difficult for doctors to diagnose. They may tell you that you are fine and just give you certain prescriptions. A patient may find out that the treatment isn&#8217;t working. With time, your gut can give you more signs that you need more opinions for different diagnoses.</p>
<p>If you have confidence in your instincts, it can save you a lot of time. And this makes it easier for your physician to guide you. Pay attention, your gut always tells you something about your health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong> Always be informed</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though physicians can&#8217;t know it all regarding our health, we still expect them to.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to wait till you are diagnosed with a critical illness before taking basic actions, always get informed.</p>
<p>You need to always push for answers when certain symptoms occur. Only you know your body best. Your doctor won&#8217;t always have all the answers to every disease.</p>
<p>Always ask important questions as to when needed and do personal research from reliable sources. Remember, it&#8217;s always your health, always be your own very best advocate.</p>
<p>With what was discussed above, you are on a sure way to <strong>getting the best medical care</strong>. Use these strategies and you will be in charge of your health.</p>
