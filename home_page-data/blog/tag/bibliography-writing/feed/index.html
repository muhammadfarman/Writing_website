										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing is a channel of communication for humans. For us; it is a sign, a type of tool, inscription, and a symbol that complements our speeches. It is our voice and oftentimes, it is stored to be referred to in the future. However, it depends solely on certain vocabulary structures which include grammar and semantics and can be transmitted across the globe at any given time. Humans write for different reasons. Sometimes, it can be for research purposes, at other times it can be to stimulate the interests of others. Whichever form and whatever reason it is intended for; our main aim is that an idea is passed across. Before we go into the bibliography writing, let’s explain the four major types of writing.</p>
<h2><strong>Different types of writing</strong></h2>
<p>Our writing styles reflect our inner voices, personality, and intellect. And since time immemorial, four styles of writing have been adopted by writers. They are:</p>
<p><strong>Expository writing</strong> – with this style of writing, a writer&#8217;s opinion is silenced. He focuses on explaining relevant facts and information rather than erring his view.</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive writing</strong> – just like the name; it describes a piece of information in great detail and the writer is specific about it.</p>
<p><strong>Persuasive writing</strong> – the main purpose of this type of writing is to persuade the reader into agreeing with the author’s point; you just have to be convinced whichever way.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative writing</strong> – unlike the others, narrative writing gives revenue for the author to be creative. He is permitted to play around with words and be imaginative while at it.</p>

<p>Having explained these styles of writing, let us go into Bibliography proper.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Bibliography?</strong></h2>
<p>By definition, it is a type of writing with a comprehensive listing of magazines, journals, books used by an author during research. It contains a complete list of every source; offline and online used during this period. And in most cases, it is not cited in the content of the research but at the end of the chapters. Bibliography entries often include the name of the author, title of the book, publication information, and the year of publishing. Well, it is important to know that there are several formats of writing bibliographies and they include:</p>
<ol>
<li>American psychological association (APA) style – used for scientific papers</li>
<li>Modern Language Association (MLA) style – specifically for humanities books, and</li>
<li>Chicago Manual Style (CMS) – basically for social sciences</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> What are the steps involved in  Bibliography writing?</strong></h2>
<p>There are many methods of writing bibliography as we mentioned earlier but we will explain them one at a time</p>
<p>Using the American psychological association format as a guideline, Bibliography can be written in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a reference list – for this, one has to set a page aside for the names of the authors cited in the project or research.</li>
<li>Arrange the references in alphabetical order</li>
<li>If there are more than seven authors for a citation, make use of ellipses.</li>
<li>Sometimes, the source of the citation might not be from persons but organizations. Whichever it is, make use of what you have at hand.</li>
<li>Make use of indents if a source takes more than a line</li>
<li>Make article citations</li>
<li>Cite books and websites</li>
<li>Search for other valid sources</li>
</ol>
<p>Modern Language Association method includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reserve a page for the citation</li>
<li>Let all titled words be capitalized</li>
<li>Double-space the citation page</li>
<li>Make an indent of 0.5 inches if the citation is more than a line</li>
<li>Arrange in alphabetical order</li>
<li>Reference books, articles, and websites</li>
<li>Search for other reliable sources</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing a Chicago Manual Style Bibliography, one has to</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a bibliography page aside</li>
<li>Let your sources be in alphabetical order</li>
<li>Single-space your sources</li>
<li>Indent a successive line</li>
<li>Cite articles, books, websites</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>In summary </strong></h2>
<p>Bibliography writing cannot be fully called a reference. The two are oftentimes confused for the other, but it is not. Nonetheless, proper research must take its course before writing this piece.</p>
