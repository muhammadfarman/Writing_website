										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before we delve into this topic, I’ll like to define a book review. A book review is simply analyzing, describing and evaluating information as found in a book. It always has an opinion conveyed with supporting details of the book. <a href="http://www.writing-world.com/">Here</a> are some tips that you can find helpful.</p>
<p>When writing a book review, you don’t have to be an expert. You can be new in the subject and write perfect reviews in the long run, only if you learn by practice and determination.</p>
<h2> Things to know before writing a book review</h2>
<ul>
<li>What does “Title” suggest?</li>
<li><strong>Scan either the introduction or preface</strong>: This gives you much better information on the writer&#8217;s thought or the overall goal of the book. Here you’ll have to identify any sort of limitation and especially if the writer has ignored significant aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Scan through the TOC or table of contents</strong>: This generally shows you how the book is arranged in its every detail. To be precise, how the ideas are arranged chronologically in the book.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some points to think through when reading a  Book</h2>
<ul>
<li>The genre of the book; is the book crime fiction, romance, science fiction, etc.</li>
<li>The point of view, what area is the writer addressing?</li>
<li>You as the reviewer, are you against or in support of the writer’s views.</li>
<li>Also, do make notes as you scan or read the whole book so as to include passages to quote in your review.</li>
<li>Are you able to follow the author’s common thread or thesis?</li>
<li>What do you think is the author’s style, is it informal or formal and overall how suitable is it for the audience you’re trying to reach out to.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/steps-involved-in-writing-seo-friendly-article/">Steps involved in writing SEO friendly article</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the information or language in the book clear and precise and are the ideas developed to an extent?</li>
<li>How about the author’s summary or conclusion, is it convincing.</li>
<li>Do the footnotes provide the necessary information?</li>
<li>If the footnotes information is relevant, you’ll have to make notes of the book&#8217;s format.</li>
<li>Is the index of the book accurate? What kind of sources was used by the author?</li>
<li>What is the goal of the book? And does the book need more work?</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to write in your points and make a unique book review</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to write the basics, that is, the title, place, author, publication date, place, price, special details, and edition.</li>
<li>Write an interesting sentence for the opening. In this part, you’ll have to set the tone for the review. Make sure you know the book&#8217;s guidelines. Some readers want you to be definite, especially if you recommend a book.</li>
<li>Keep it clear in your own style.</li>
<li>If this book is really good, write it down and tell your audience why.</li>
<li>Include all of the author’s details and perhaps his authority on the subject</li>
<li>Who is your target audience, think like them by knowing how they’ll react when reading your review.</li>
<li>The conclusion of your review should give a detailed summary of the book.</li>
<li>At the end of it all, you revise what you’ve done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to write a book review for a fictional novel</h2>
<p>These are some basic things to note before writing the review</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the story all about?</li>
<li>Who are the main characters?</li>
<li>Are the characters authentic in the book?</li>
<li>What did the protagonist do in the story?</li>
<li>Were there any problems faced by the protagonists?</li>
<li>Who is your best character in the book?</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also include your personal experiences at this level:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much can you relate to the story?</li>
<li>Do you have any perception of any of the characters as relative to your own experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>Do include your suggestions at this level</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain briefly how much you enjoyed the book</li>
<li>Tell your audience your best part in the book</li>
<li>What part of the book do you dislike?</li>
<li>If you were given the opportunity what would you change in the book?</li>
</ul>
<p>What is your recommendation?</p>
<ul>
<li>How much would you recommend this book to either a friend or any other person?</li>
<li>What kind of person would enjoy this book?</li>
</ul>
<p>So in essence, if you want to begin well, then do not review based on emotional preferences but do it based on your opinion. You can start by reviewing weekly magazines or journals on a particular subject. As you practice with determination, you’ll surely be a good book reviewer.</p>
