										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business page is probably one of your most powerful tools at your disposal right now. But then, the blog might not be as efficient as it should. Why is this so? Well, the reasons are numerous but we won’t be focusing majorly on that. Rather, we will be discussing how to structure your business blog posts on your business blog to enable maximum conversion.</p>
<p>Quite tyrannical, is it? Don’t be too hard on yourself, we’ve got your back. With this article, you should be ready to roll in no time. Let’s begin.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structuring your business blog posts</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, there are certain elements that are key in every blog post and domain.  While some are easily noticeable, the others aren’t but altogether, they play an essential role in making or marring your life. Here’s what you should consider when structuring a blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary business page navigation</strong>: Regardless of whether the user isn’t checking out the business section of your blog, it a important that you make them learn about your business; the services you offer and the goods you sell. You can do this by including a simple navigation menu to the primary business page.</li>
<li><strong>Content grouping</strong>: Now that you have got guests on your platform, you should encourage them to stay. Ensure that they can browse through available content with ease by grouping the content, either by content, topic of skill level.</li>
<li><strong>Search box</strong>: Users should be able to look up for what they are exactly looking for by simply teaching for it. A simple search box on the side is enough for that.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">HOW TO FACILITATE A PROPER BOOK REVIEW </a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subscription options:</strong> Readers should be encouraged to follow up on the content on your blog. You’d do well by including a way to subscribe to your content either via RSS or email.</li>
<li><strong>Preview posts are important</strong>:  Most of the time, we tend to have scanners, then real viewers or readers. Allow them the opportunity to skim your contents by offering them preview posts. If you can, include a clickable image to draw in more attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, every one of your business blog posts should have five essential characteristics, including the content itself.   The elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Call-to-Actions (CTAs):</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, this element is very essential for your blog post to make conversions. The more you dedicate to it, the more conversion you’re more likely to have. Of course, you don’t have any excuse not to have it. They are the essentiality on which your readers’ interest are developed. To the layman, CTAs aren’t really worth too much attention, after all it is just a button. Yes, this is right but trust me, the last thing you want to do now is to lose valuable conversions. You’d be killing the business even before it got started. However, there quite a lot of ways you can optimize your CTAs. You just have to look through what exactly will work for you. Once you’ve successfully done this, you are one step ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>: Hey, don’t be a boring host. Your blog post shouldn’t be all about“business-like” text. No, it might sound boring to some readers. Try including at least an image to spice up the readers psyche.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Quick load time</strong></h3>
<p>: As aforesaid, most online shoppers and readers are more scanners than readers. They don’t have the liberty of patience to wait for your page to load for lengthy periods. So, you should ensure that your business page doesn’t take more than three seconds before it can be accessed. If you can, a less than 2 seconds period is just good enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are done with structuring your page, let’s move on to the next important thing.</p>
<h2>          2.    SEO of your business blog posts</h2>
<p>Well, no blog content goes past without saying more than a “Hi” to this. Trust me, you need to be familiar with this.  While you’re aiming to reach your targeted audience, you should also consider search engine optimization.  You need as many inorganic guests as you need organic ones. After all, it is for the growth of your business. Here’s what you should do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporate your blog with the primary business page domain</strong>: Make sure to host your blog page within your fundamental domain rather than externally hosting your blog. This way, you wouldn’t have to murder the SEO administration by causing two domains to compete against themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A keyword-focused page title is essential</strong>&#8211; Rather than denoting your blog with “Company’s Blog”, you should consider the opportunity keyword optimization is offering you. Since search engines emphasize left-closed words, your blog&#8217;s page title should be named with something that is keyword-related before even including your company’s name. This way, you can actually lay proper claims for those keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-descriptions are equally great</strong> &#8211; These are more of a summary description of your search engines webpage. Ensure that your post contains this description, one of the obviously related keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t forget internal links:</strong> While you are navigating to other blog structure contents, you shouldn’t forget about linking relevant content from one post to another. Provide your reader with internally linked to other pages within your domain with relevant strategic caster text to enable better keyword ranking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve successfully integrated all of these, then you would have successfully given your blogpost a boost to rank better on SEO</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Social Media</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every business blog owner wants to share their content with every part of cyberspace. But the question is; how prepared are these contents for social media? Are they properly optimized? If not, then you need to go back and integrate steps 1 and 2 of this piece to your business webpage. Only then are you worthy of considering this phase. But how do you know whether or not your blog is rightly optimized? Well, we dealt with that in this piece.</p>
<p>First off, you have to optimize your blog  homepage and then follow these social tips.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Provide your guest with social subscription options in your business blog posts: </strong></h3>
<p>Give your readers the option to follow your blog on any social network they prefer. This would encourage better interaction on the social media, away from the blog itself.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Social proof display: </strong></h3>
<p>This is proof that your audience is motivated socially, not just by your blog posts. To achieve this, you have to ensure that there is social interaction on your blog. If you can, create a live-feed of how people are tweeting on your business social network handle.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it. Quite a lot of optimizing it is. But then, if you’re able to take the time to integrate every of the mentioned phases and sub-phases in this article, you are good to go. You don’t have to be a multi-billion dollar firm before you can reach out to the social network, you could run your business page right there where you’re sorted by creating unique business blog posts. You just have to get it right.</p>
