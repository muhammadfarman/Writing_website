										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your boss just asked you to write a business report for the quarter, and you&#8217;ve been panicky ever since. The fact is, &#8220;you can&#8217;t write a proper business report!&#8221;</p>
<h2>What is a business report?</h2>
<p>A business report is a document that contains all important facts and figures about an aspect of a business, over some time.<br />
Business reports help an organization in decision making and make them aware of their marketing strategies are working.</p>
<p>Writing a business report is a chronological process. There are listed steps and processes you must follow to get it right. This article is aimed at teaching these steps and how they can be used to create a good report.</p>
<h2>Steps involved in writing a business report</h2>
<h3> Understand the purpose</h3>
<p>The first step in writing any business report is understanding or determining the purpose of the report. The purpose of the report determines the style and nature of the document, to a great extent. For instance, a financial report should make the company aware of their spending practices and if it&#8217;s paying off or not.</p>
<h3>Collect the needed information</h3>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t know everything about your organization. To write a useful and well-detailed report, you&#8217;ll need to collect relevant information about the company.<br />
Information can be sourced from the company files, letters, questionnaires, etc. These can then be used to get the necessary information for the report.</p>
<h3>Know the readers</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t possibly write a well-targeted and extremely successful report if you don&#8217;t know the readers. Understanding the reader(s) knowledge level, position in the organization and previous knowledge about the topic help write a successful report.</p>
<h3>Review the information</h3>
<p>Now the readers are known, and the information is there. The next step is reviewing and analyzing the collected information.<br />
Not all the collected information is to be used. Some of the information that may seem irrelevant to the report has to be discarded in a non-bias manner. Then, the needed ones are systematically and logically arranged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Select a writing method</h3>
<p>Before you start any writing, it&#8217;s important to choose a preferred style of writing. There are two major writing styles, and the one chosen depends on the purpose of the report.</p>
<p>These styles of writing are:<br />
• <strong>The inductive style</strong>: The inductive style is best for a standard business report. The writer has to introduce and analyze at first, before writing the summary, suggestions, and conclusion.<br />
• <strong>The deductive style</strong>: This is best for reports spanning short periods. Here, the writer may write the summary and recommendation before writing the introduction and analysis.<br />
Getting the right style is key and will greatly influence how the report is viewed.</p>
<h3>Write the outline</h3>
<p>Once the information is carefully arranged, you have to write an outline. An outline is just a draft of all points you plan to discuss in the business report.<br />
An outline is compulsory for a successful report, as it prevents the writer from making nursery school mistakes.</p>
<h3>Write the business report</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re done outlining your report, what next? Fire on, and write.<br />
However, before preparing the final copy, be sure to make a rough draft. The rough draft should be carefully checked for any spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. It should also be checked for the accuracy of information. The final copy is then reread to make sure it follows a logical sequence.<br />
Once you&#8217;re done writing the final copy, the report can be submitted for reading and review by the reader.<br />
When you follow the above-mentioned steps in writing your report, don&#8217;t be amazed when you&#8217;re the next to be chosen for a promotion! Click <a href="Click%20here%20for%20sample%20business%20report%20here">here</a> for sample business report</p>
