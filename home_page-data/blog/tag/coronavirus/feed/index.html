										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, there have been global growing anxieties about the new, widespread coronavirus. According to global reports, the number of infected patients has increasingly risen and there are other suggestive reports of other isolated places across the world, owing to international travels.</p>
<p>This deadly disease was discovered in Wuhan, a sub-city in China in 2019. Since then, over 1300 cases of the diseases have been reported, and not less than 40 deaths recorded.</p>
<p>However, the government of many countries has charged their public health officials to put measures in place to efficiently put a stop of the virus. In a bid to justify this move, there have been temporary travel restrictions to and from Wuhan, China. In more mild cases of emergency travels, strict health screening measures have been put in place to curtail the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>However, with the ever-evolving information and news about this deadly virus, it wouldn’t be out of place if you’re worried. You’re concerned as to what to do, and what not to do. How do you avoid it? Can it be treated? These and many other questions are what are plaguing your thoughts.</p>
<p>Anyways, we’ve done justice to your worries. In this article, we have highlighted notable information to enable you to gain more insight into the virus. Take your time to read through and you can be sure to stay safe. For more history and information about the coronavirus, read <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">here</a> or wait for subsequent posts about it on this platform.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a coronavirus?</strong></h2>
<p>Actually, there is no specific clarity about what  coronaviruses are. However, some medical experts choose to explain it as an awfully widespread cause of colds as well as upper respiratory infections. Usually, these viruses are zoonoses, meaning that they have the capacity to spread from certain animals to another, and in more severe cases, spread to humans especially if there are occurrence changes in the virus.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the health authorities in China received lots of reported groups of pneumonia sicknesses in late December 2019. Further researches exposed that most of the sick people had come in contact with the animal and seafood market in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has been a major transfer from one person to the other, thereby resulting in an alarming widespread.</p>
<h2><strong>Symptoms of Coronavirus</strong></h2>
<p>The symptoms of the coronavirus vary. It could include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Possible fever</li>
</ul>
<p>In more severe cases, the likes of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting happen.</p>
<p>If discovered earlier, it can be treated and the patient recovers within a short while. However, the same can not be said for the elderly, very young ones or people with a weakened immune system. They can result in more serious complications such as pneumonia, and bronchitis.</p>
<h2><strong>Can the coronavirus be treated?  </strong></h2>
<p>As of now, there are no remedial solutions for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, scientists are working hand in hand with the global government, especially with the Chinese public health authorities to get a cure for the coronavirus. For critical cases, the patients are moved to specialized, aggressive care, in an intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Here is a list of countries where the coronavirus has been discovered.  If you can, avoid unnecessary visits to these countries and even if you must, make sure that you are properly sanitized and treated prior and after your visit.</p>
<ul>
<li>China</li>
<li>United States</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>South Korea</li>
<li>Taiwan</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Thailand</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Nepal</li>
<li>Vietnam</li>
<li>Hong Kong</li>
<li>Macau</li>
<li>Malaysia</li>
<li>Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>These are every day habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Make sure to cough or sneeze with a tissue, and then discard the tissue in a trash can.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces like doorknobs, tables, chairs, etc.</li>
<li>If someone coughs or sneezes around you, cover your nose and mouth with tissue paper/ then discard into the trash bin.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is believed that the virus is spread through coughing, sneezing, and touching of infected surfaces, so please do your best to avoid this as much as possible.</p>
<p>Avoid any animals they bring from there (alive or dead), avoid anything they bought from any seafood market or animal markets in China, and stay away from any animal products (such as fish, seafood or any uncooked meat).</p>
<h2><strong>Do you have to be bothered about catching it? </strong></h2>
<p>Well, unless you’ve had close contact with a coronavirus patient, you are probably safe as you can be. But then, you never can be too sure, hence you should visit a health center for proper checkup.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the widespread of this deadly virus owning to the complexity and pace of international travel, there is a great chance that the number of infections and death tolls will increase massively in days to come. Nevertheless, it is no reason to panic. But then, we have to be extremely careful about our daily activities. Adhering to the above hygiene processes will give you a better chance of staying safe. Moreover, as more information about this deadly virus become available, we are confident that health organizations around the world will get more details and strategies to help in curtailing the virus.</p>
