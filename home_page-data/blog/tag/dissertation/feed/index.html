										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brief: This is commonly the first step in academic pursuit, especially the prolific kind. It typically gives a scholar the right foundation and means to acquire a professional degree. It helps the writer in writing a unique dissertation.</p>
<h2>How to write a unique dissertation (the steps)</h2>
<p>Knowing how to write a dissertation is the first step to gaining relevance in the academic field. You’ll have to gather all information as learned from the past four years in school and make a concretely thrilling, and lengthy document to impress a majority of the thought leaders. And you have to know this, dissertations can take a while to be fully done.</p>

<h3>Step 1: write a solid proposal</h3>
<p>This is simply proving yourself to the members of the graduate committee. You must make them believe they are going to address complex, challenging questions. Such a proposal should address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of problem is going to be addressed?</li>
<li>Why is such a problem an issue for the academic circle?</li>
<li>Why is a solution needed?</li>
<li>What sort of technique can be used?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no strict guidelines on how a proposal should be but simply clarify your point.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the things to keep in mind when making your research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a timeline</li>
<li>Research thoroughly for sources</li>
<li>Make sure to always keep your sources and findings in an arranged order</li>
</ul>

<p>After your proposal has been submitted and accepted, and all findings to the topic have been done. It is now time to get your pen working. You also have to know this, there is more credit when making an outline first of all.</p>
<p>This is a basic outline for a dissertation, which includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Literature review</li>
<li>Methodology</li>
<li>Findings</li>
<li>Defense or conclusion</li>
<li>Bibliography or citation</li>
</ol>
<p>Once done with the outline, and you have completed the task, and also organized all sources. The next task would be writing your first draft.</p>

<h2>How long should be a dissertation</h2>
<p>Writing a unique dissertation can be a complex task, which takes a lot of patience on your part. This should not as a surprise to you, especially the average dissertation length which is from the range of 40,000- 120,000.</p>
<p>A dissertation is also broken down into a number of chapters for an easy read. It must also include the basic outline, without which the dissertation is useless.  You’ll also have to know that appropriate formatting, printing, and binding is also a necessity.</p>
<h2>The difference between a thesis and a dissertation</h2>
<p>Dissertation: wholly exclusive for doctoral studies. Generally concerned with contributing newer ideas to a field.</p>
<p>Thesis: wholly exclusive for master&#8217;s degree holders. It is also used to verify the student&#8217;s overall knowledge throughout the end of his or her graduate studies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A dissertation is for all purposes, and it is not limited to a specific field. Its main objective is to know if the student is well learned in all the things that he or she has been taught in school. The academic committee’s only desire is for the student to be more able to communicate his or her points on the subject by writing thought-provoking literature reviews. If you have this technic and know how to communicate your points, and that’s by reading all instructions as given above. Then you’re on your way for success.</p>
