										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drugs respond sensitively to the body. Before the production of the ones we use, they must go through a thorough drug development process. In the awakening of some drugs, a lot more tends to fall by the wayside. Nevertheless, these drugs go through various tests like cost-effective analysis and rigorous testing. According to the <a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/publications/tomorrows-pharmacist/drug-development-the-journey-of-a-medicine-from-lab-to-shelf/20068196.article?firstPass=false">Pharmaceutical Journal</a>, the drug development process yields some compounds. Some make it to the market and take around 12 years, costing about Â£1.15bn.</p>
<p>Who knows the starting point of these drugs? It may be a university laboratory. The work, however, may be carried out by individuals who the government gave access to do so. In general, the government grants access to specific bodies to do research, test, and analysis on diseases with the hope of getting treatment. Along the line, these individuals discover new drugs.</p>
<p>So, the process is more like a thorough understanding of diseases, sickness, and genes. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) makes sure a drug is safe before giving it to humans. The company then assigns a clinical trial on these drugs and volunteered experts to manage the process.</p>
<h2><strong>The drug development process</strong></h2>
<p>For this reason, the drug development process is vital and thorough, and they include:</p>
<h3><strong>Clinical Trial</strong></h3>
<p>Once the government grants permission to apply the Clinical Trial (CTA), a small group of volunteers &#8211; about 20-100 healthy individuals test these drugs. Small doses are then administered to these people who are closely watched and supervised- the process is called a Phase 1 trial. After thorough checking, only half of these compounds reach the phase 2 trial.</p>
<p>The phase 2 trial is a bit different. Here, volunteered patients with the exact condition do the testing. The trial covers just a little amount of these patients, which is usually 100-500 people. Most failed drugs are usually detected in phase 2 because they prove the inefficiency of some compounds.</p>

<p>Phase 3 trial covers a greater amount of groups across many international sites &#8211; 1000-5000 patients. This stage aims at identifying the right dosage as well as confirming the drugs for use.</p>
<h3><strong>Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>The marketing process involves the attaining of authorization from national regulatory bodies. Note that this is only valid after the successful completion of the phase 3 trial. The MHRA submits authorization for the UK and its citizens. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does that, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) collects authorization for the whole of Europe. So, Europeans do not have to collect nationally. The submission details cover all the requirements. Some of these include toxicity, dosage, pharmacology, chemical makeup, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Patenting</strong></h3>
<p>Health bodies, usually, will patent drugs with an effective response in the early stage of preparation. While this is a component of the process, it ensures that the drugs stay unique for about 20 years. Also, using the process to recover the loss from failed drugs.</p>
<p>Once a patent expires, other bodies can copy and implement your work to provide the same drugs. Patenting serves as protection. Regulatory organizations can, however, collect a patent extension of an additional five years upon expiration.</p>
<h3><strong>Supportive Innovation</strong></h3>
<p>Somehow, supportive innovation is a component of the drug development process. In consideration of some drugs&#8217; toxicity, some groups and organizations offer a helping hand by supporting information, specialities, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Hypothetically, the tested drugs estimates in large amount, a few make it to the market, one recoups for all the investment. So far, it indicates that the drug development process may become more flexible in the future.</p>
