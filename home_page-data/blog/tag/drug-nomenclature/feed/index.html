<p>The method of naming drug groups into three; a chemical, a generic, and a brand name. Regardless of the naming system, there applies a method and source. Some find themselves useful to the clinical trial while others don&#8217;t. Above all, the names are useful, covering its aspect, and are termed Drug Nomenclature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we continue, let&#8217;s look at a broad description of these three naming systems <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/414871_5">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/drug-development-process-the-steps-and-necessities-involved/"><strong>Drug nomenclature: The art of naming drugs</strong></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the different types are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Naming</strong></p>
<p>The chemical name adopts a chemical nomenclature of compounds. One thing is people often term this type of drug nomenclature as one for the book gurus. The usage never extends to clinical or marketing trials. The chemical name describes the chemical structure of a drug. It also states in terms of atoms and molecules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Generic naming</strong></p>
<p>The USAN council grants the generic name of drugs. The name is vital throughout a clinical lifetime. While the company uses a brand name to market drugs. This name is more like an approved one. The coming up of this name couldn&#8217;t have been possible if there&#8217;s no collaboration with the Food and Drugs Board. Another involved the Nomenclature committee. Observing why this name is in place disclosed the efficacy of it. Avoidably, there&#8217;s no reason for the confusion of names among the drugs. Each and everyone is set straight with its generic name. Noticeably, they always begin with a lowercase letter. For example, aluminium hydroxide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brand naming</strong></p>
<p>Brand naming is the face of the market. It is one which accompanies the company&#8217;s name and activities. All of these names follow copyright laws and prevent others from using the same product name. Or still, it disallows the act of using the identical product for the trade name. However, it is important to take note that, at times, one drug can possess many trade names. An example is Acetaminophen, having 30 names; some of which involve paracetamol, Paramol, Tylenol, Capol, and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Drugs dispensing</strong></p>
<p>The two ways of dispensing drugs are the Over-the-counter and Prescription method. The two methods have some advantages as well as disadvantages. Nevertheless, let&#8217;s look at what both of them mean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-the-counter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This group contains drugs that don&#8217;t need a prescription to acquire them. Some of them include pain relievers, blood tonics, ORS, antacids, vitamin preparation, antimalarials, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prescription</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These are the type of drugs that need a prescription paper from the doctor. Drugs like this often require this because of its usage abuse. More importantly, to ensure safe use. The primary goal is to control the usage of these drugs and also tackle dependence. Some examples are antibiotics, sedatives, anti-hypertensives, and diabetic drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rules of drug administration</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also accompanied are the rules involved in administering drugs for use. The process requires thorough handling, hence, it comes with these rules:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Always take note of prescription details. Make sure you understand and assign drugs to the right patients.</li>
<li>Checking for drug accuracy is also important, and better done with the label. Doing this helps to figure when a drug is not in its container.</li>
<li>You should give drugs according to their strength. They should reflect the dosage by strength and not quantity.</li>
<li>Ensure the wholesome of drugs by checking for expiring dates, colour, and consistency.</li>
<li>Apply your specialities with the handling process.</li>
<li>Give adequate prescribing details. Make sure the patient gets adequate information.</li>
<li>Keep records of almost all activities.</li>
<li>Aim at improving compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Drug nomenclature is not an easy process. It&#8217;s almost like the manufacturing of drugs itself because the companies also have to go through thorough approvals. This, however, helps to provide copyrighted compounds. Drugs also require that you dispense them the right way. Fortunately, the rules guide to help achieve drug circulation.</p>
