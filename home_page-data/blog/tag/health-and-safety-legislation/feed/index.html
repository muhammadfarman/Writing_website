										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People usually don&#8217;t see hazardous occurrence coming, but it strikes hard when in place, especially in a care setting. Whether in a hospital, a care facility, or related centres, there must be certainty of safety. In healthcare, one has to be careful about everything &#8211; treating patients, first aid giving, and others. There are regulations, hereafter called health and safety legislation guiding the practices in a care setting. These rules govern organizations and groups, also providing principles to follow. Generally, the proposed law applies to all sectors and is generally acceptable. Why? Because it promotes safe practice in the workplace, and also help to achieve certain goals.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, not applying these rules is of great danger. It is not in any way apprehended and can attract penalties if not obeyed. Regardless of your profiles or reputation, you will dance to the tune of your music if these rules are not in place. To back my claim, visit <a href="https://www.scie.org.uk/publications/guides/guide15/legislation/otherlegislation/healthandsafetylegislation.asp">here</a> to how some bodies were penalized in the past for choosing to neglect the proposed laws governing the health and safety legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The health and safety legislation in a workplace</strong></h2>
<p>Hence, it&#8217;s a must that every person in a workplace know and implement these rules. If you fall under the health sector and do not know these laws, you probably have to stop sitting on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Health and Safety at Work Act 1974</strong></h2>
<p>The act is put in place for ensuring safety in various sectors, not excluding any. Supportive inventions are introduced to make this act efficiently. Also, providing an interface for the European regulations. The HSE, however, enforces it in a way that it attaches serious consequences. Some of them include prison sentences and unlimited fines. So, it&#8217;s the job of employees to work accordingly with this act by implementing the employer&#8217;s health and safety requirements.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/the-nursing-career-path-reasons-for-choosing-to-nurse-as-a-career/">The role of Paramedic in General Healthcare</a></h2>
<h2><strong>The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 (Modified)</strong></h2>
<p>Notably, manual handling is a major issue faced by workers. Why? People with limited mobility needs manual handling, at the same time, must not feel deprived of his or her human rights. Therefore, the law mentioned above governs the manual process of helping catered patients to move and transfer from one place to another.</p>
<p>The challenges that care workers experience is a bit complicated. This is in consideration of the blanket ban imposed by a county council on its employees. As a result, it prevented certain individuals from getting the appropriate care and treatment.</p>
<p>Accountably, the court stated that that the ban does not prohibit patients from getting their normal treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Reporting of Injuries, Diseases, and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995</strong></h2>
<p>Employers, employees, and individuals in a work premises subjects to report health-related issues. These include death, serious injuries, accidents, diseases, and merely dangerous occurrences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1981</strong></h2>
<p>To ensure adequate safety, a complete first aid treatment must be available, also including the necessary equipment. Does it stop there? Of course, no! Employers also have to make sure that there is first aid enlightenment among the workers &#8211; in case of sudden happenings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Control of Substances Hazardous to Health 2002</strong></h2>
<p>There must be proper usage of harmful materials in the workplace &#8211; mostly medications and cleaning equipment. Employers must, however, make sure that these materials are safely stored. Also, well-trained workers should be the only ones using any hazardous substance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Food Safety Act 1990, Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations 1995 and Food Safety (Temperature Control) Regulations 1995</strong></p>
<p>The act covers the development process of food for safe consumption. It ensures that food businesses register themselves whether they seek profit or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>All these are necessities and does not exclude any kind of work. Employers and workers should work together, yielding and implementing health and safety.</p>
