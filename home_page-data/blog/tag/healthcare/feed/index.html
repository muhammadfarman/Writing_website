										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, technology is making healthcare more accessible and affordable to the mass. So far, scientists have come up with technologies that can help humans attain good health. From genomics to 3D bioprinting, etc. The innovation continues.</p>
<p>Through these technologies, scientists have discovered various ways that help humans live longer, more productive, and healthier lives.</p>
<p>Even with all these been said, less has been talked about on ways these health technologies have influenced the healthcare industry. Again, it is important to discuss how these technologies will be more accessible to locations having challenges in accessing adequate healthcare.</p>
<p>The digital health industry recently provides few insights into the various changes it has on healthcare. Below are ways of how technology is currently making healthcare more accessible to the masses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Ways Technology Is Making Healthcare More Accessible And Affordable</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Remote visits by doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a fact that people living in rural areas lack easy access to quality and adequate healthcare. According to recent statistics, about 10% of the doctors living in the US are available in rural areas, posing a serious problem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/orders-and-how-they-are-passed-in-writing-errands/">Orders and how they are passed in writing errands</a></h2>
<p>Now, telemedicine was innovated to solve these major challenges. It does this by providing a system of various remote medical consultations. With this development, patients can always speak with a healthcare provider by means of electronic &#8211; often phone or video.</p>
<p>Today, this field is growing strongly. It&#8217;s currently been used by more than a million people. These services seem to be a lot cheaper than the in-person system of doctor visits. It means individuals with low income can afford to speak with doctors. Today, millions of Americans are currently lacking health insurance.</p>
<p>Although the services rendered via telemedicine cannot treat all ailments. They are an effective and flourishing alternative to the need for frequent doctor visits. It only requires the assessment of symptoms and some prescriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Artificial intelligence doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is truly changing how many things are done. That is even in the healthcare industry. Although, some people may feel reluctant to consult with an AI doctor. Even if this is the case, this type of technology can still be more reputable than it could be imagined.</p>
<p>Just recently, artificial intelligence defeated some human doctors in a clinical exam. The British firm Babylon and other companies are striving to develop some applications that could help users obtain medical advice. This is from the comfort of their mobile devices.</p>
<p>AI technology is also capable of learning over a long period of time while building more experience. This will help people to have access to medical advice easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>The use of remote monitoring</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the help of health technology,  healthcare providers now find it easier to monitor the health status of their patients remotely. This now eliminates the need for patients to always visit their doctors face-to-face for follow-ups.  That is after which the treatment of a particular condition.</p>
<p>Today, there are different sorts of technologies that enable this to be possible. Some of the well-known applications are used for uploading information like blood sugar readings to healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Also, patients could wear devices that measure and give instant records. Most are wireless devices for transmitting information needed by the medical team. Home monitoring devices can also be used by senior citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Use of some personal health applications</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many personal apps have been created in many industries for health. This has also solved some problems. Today, lots of personal health apps can be found in the marketplace. They are mainly built for the purpose of helping people organize certain medical information.</p>
<p>With them, consumers can easily store important personal health information. There are many useful things these digital health tools can be used for. Combining different health apps can almost serve one as a personal doctor.</p>
<p>This health technology helps consumers take personal health into their hands. They offer 24/7 access to different medical pieces of information that are useful in making decisions when a doctor isn&#8217;t available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>E-consultation for doctors</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As many of the medical specialists practice in urban areas, those residing in rural areas must travel long distances for serious health issues. For one, it is time-consuming and quite expensive. The innovation of some electronic consultations has solved this problem, to an extent. Now, there are tools for video conferencing which are used by primary care physicians located in rural areas. This allows them to virtually speak with those specialists.</p>
<p>With a tool like this, the physicians will gain the required knowledge for helping their patients. This means the patient doesn&#8217;t need to travel to visit a specialist.</p>
<p>As modern technology continues to be useful in many areas of healthcare, uninsured individuals, low-income earners, and people residing in rural areas will be getting more access to the quality healthcare they deserve.</p>
<p>Here is how health technologies are reducing <a href="https://tincture.io/healthcare-technologies-reducing-risk-increasing-access-fded547517e0?gi=a35624840093">dangerous health risks</a>.</p>
