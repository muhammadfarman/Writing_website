										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to general growing health statistics all over the world, fiber is one of the major reasons why the whole grain&#8217;s sustenance is good for you. In fact, many health practitioners prove that regular ingest of fiber in your food gives you a better chance of reducing chronic diseases and have great digestion.  More than these, there are a lot more than you can actually get from eating fiber. In a bid to affirm the importance of ingesting fiber, health authorities recommend that the male and female folks eat as much as 38 and 25 fiber grams respectively in other to have a healthy diet every day.</p>
<p>To further enlighten us better about the benefits of having fibers in our diets, this article provides us with health evidence to keep us on the high.  Yet, before we venture into it, let’s deal with the following question.</p>
<h2><strong><em>What Is Fiber?</em></strong></h2>
<p>In a layman explanation, dietary fiber is the non-digestible carbohydrate available in our foods.  Meanwhile, it is further divided into two which will help you to have a healthy diet;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soluble fiber</strong>: These are the kind of fibers that can be dissolved in water and has the capacity to be broken down by guts bacteria.</li>
<li><strong>Insoluble fiber</strong>: These are the direct opposite of soluble fibers. They are non-dissolvable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, it is important to remember that fibers come in different forms. While some of them are necessary health-wise, the others are basically useless.  Further extension between soluble and insoluble fibers explains that the latter has the capacity to be digested by the good bacteria in the intestine, and most foods contain both forms of fibers.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<h2><strong>The importance of eating fibers for a healthy diet</strong></h2>
<p>We have highlighted some of the major important reasons for eating fibers. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Fiber is essential for a healthy diet and food for &#8220;Good&#8221; Gut Bacteria </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, there are more bacteria in the human body than the number of cells. It ratios with a difference of 10 to 1.   Bacteria that live in the human body outnumber the body&#8217;s cells 10 to 1.</p>
<p>Usually, the primary place of abode for this bacteria is in the mouth, the skin, nose and majorly in the large intestine guts, numbering more than 500 different species and about 100 trillion cells.</p>
<p>Hey, don’t be scared by the huge numbers of bacteria available in your body. It’s rather a good thing and there is a beneficial mutual relationship. A good number of these bacteria make it easier for you to digest food and help your body deal with certain irregularities. You, in return, serve as a host where they live.</p>
<p>Some of the mutual benefits that you earn from the relationship include regulating blood sugar, optimal brain functions, weight control, and even some immune system functionality.</p>
<p>Yes, but what has Fiber got to do with all of these?</p>
<p>Well, just like every other organism, there is a need for your bacteria to eat and earn survival energy to function well. Since most foods are absorbed into the bloodstream before they find their way into the large intestine, only little is left for the guts bacteria to feed on.</p>
<p>So, you see where fiber comes in handy! Normally, the human cells are unable to produce the enzyme that can process fibers, hence it is left untouched till it gets to the guts. Only then can the bacteria there has a swell time, processing them and making them function as prebiotics.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Fibers help in controlling excessive weight through a healthy diet</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you don’t know, fibers can be efficiently helpful when watching weight by ameliorating your appetite.</p>
<p>Certain studies put it that ingesting a good amount of dietary fiber can influence weight loss by naturally taking down the intake of calories.</p>
<p>Fiber actually soaks up water from the intestine by slowly absorbing the nutrients of the diet and giving a complete feeling of fullness. However, it depends on the kind of fiber involved.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Influences Blood Sugar Spikes</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Foods that contain a high amount of fiber have the potentials of having a lower glycemic index than their refined carb, off-fiber counterpart. Thus, it is more important to eat high-viscosity and soluble fibers.</p>
<p>With these forms of fiber, there are greater advantages that you’d amass the little number of sugar spikes and thereby reduce your chances of high blood pressure.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong>How about Constipation issues? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important considerable factor about the fiber is its capacity to reduce constipation. Generally, fiber absorbs water.  And as such, the bulk of your stool is soaked up and sped through your intestine with ease. However, there is a shred of more conflicting evidence to back up this claim.</p>
<p>While certain studies prove that the intake of fiber improves constipation symptoms, other studies have countered this claim by affirming that fiber reduces constipation. In actuality, both claims are correct. The effects are dependent on the kind of fiber being ingested.  Hence, it is important that you contact a health professional, preferably a nutritionist to put you through the kind of fiber that is best for you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you’re gunning to lead a healthy lifestyle and have a healthy diet, ensure that you eat adequate healthy foods such as grains, nuts, fruits and vegetables that contain adequate fiber. Be guided, your Health is your Wealth.</p>
