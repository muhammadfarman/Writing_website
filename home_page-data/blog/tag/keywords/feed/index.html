										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to attract more visitors from the search engine? And at the same time making your visitors to really read your articles. Then you must pay more attention to creating SEO friendly articles. The layout and appearance of your article are very important. By now, there is no need to explain to you why writing an SEO friendly article is so important. But many entrepreneurs still don&#8217;t know how to write an effective SEO friendly article.</p>
<p>Search engines love good content. Content that answers the search query of the internet user. Based on content, search engines evaluate a website and &#8216;rank&#8217; it to a position in the search engine.</p>
<h2><strong>Steps to Follow to Write a Good SEO friendly Article</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Brainstorm for Article Ideas</strong></h2>
<p>Your article should have a specific need you want to address. Think about the information or vision that you want to convey, which also matches what your target group would like to know more about.</p>
<p>Remember that you write SEO articles mainly for your visitors. Think about it like a manual with important information. What do you want to present in it that explains to visitors what you are doing, what your business stands for or how your vision is different from other competitors. This information will be interesting to write about. In this way, you write SEO content that, even if they would not get more exposure, they add value to your visitors.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/the-steps-involved-in-writing-a-unique-term-paper/">The Steps Involved in Writing a Unique Term Paper</a></h2>
<p>You can try to make a mind map, with the product, service or company with the article theme you want to create in the center. Include the benefits a user will get, the properties of your service or the services offered by your company around it.</p>
<h2><strong>Write Strategically by Planning Your Content</strong></h2>
<p>Good ideas for an article can come up just at any time. It is important to plan every SEO article in advance so that you can work on it according to a clear structure and strategy.</p>
<p>Some search engines love periodic blogs best. With this said, if you publish an article weekly, every two weeks or monthly, the search engine recognizes the pattern and indexes new blog posts immediately.</p>
<p>You can have your article written on the basis of keyword research, and a content plan for creating and publishing. Gather related keywords periodically, that you will be writing about. Learn more about keyword research <a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/keyword-research">here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Optimize Main and Sub-search Keywords</strong></h2>
<p>It is important to use one main search term and a number of sub-search terms in your SEO article.</p>
<p>The main keyword is the most important term for the article. In this case, let it appear both the title and in an intermediate heading, and also a few times in the text. The sub-keywords you add make your content stand out in search engines. Search engines love this. Add more related keywords to your articles. You don&#8217;t need to use these sub-search terms in the title and headers, but occasionally in the text.</p>
<h2><strong>The Right Article Length</strong></h2>
<p>According to recent research, long article content usually gets the best read by the targeted audience. There seems to be a very clear correlation between the length of a blog post and the organic exposure of a website or blog. Of course, a long article shouldn&#8217;t be an end in itself, but if you truly have something interesting to say, this can be a very good choice online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The length of an article depends on various factors, such as the type of keywords you are targeting. If it is a keyword that has a high search volume, highly competitive and a low click potential, and you want to achieve the highest possible position, a long and comprehensive article can help with this (1,000 to 2,000 words). Conversely, for more specific terms with a lower volume and less competition, it may be sufficient to write a 500-word article about the subject.</p>
<h2><strong>Write and Review</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Â </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s now time to begin writing. Use the steps above to input your targeted keywords within your content. Write clearly. Also make sure that you always check for spelling, grammar, and sentence structure. Nothing is more annoying to a reader than texts containing errors. Errors distract attention to the content. Leave your article for a while and read it, then edit.</p>
<p>Again, you can include some internal and external links within your article for more exposure.</p>
<p>Follow the steps above and you will always create SEO friendly articles.</p>
