										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to extensive health research from the World Health Organization, (WHO) more than 10% of the total global population risk having kidney stones over the course of a lifetime. In recent times, the risk percent seem to have grown massively.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are serious misconceptions as to the causes of kidney stones even amongst elites. To deal with this, this article outlines the major causes and prevention of kidney stones.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-stones%23risk-factors&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8z5W2iq3nAhVLi1wKHaDDBLoQpYkCKAEwDnoECA0QCA&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wNYnpdEL21K9HcAyBbMkV">here</a> to learn more about the risk factors of kidney stones and how to avoid them.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Causes of Kidney stones and solutions</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Sweat Carefully</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Exercises are healthy for health. They help to stay fit and agile for other activities. But then, they have the potential of resulting in kidney stones. How’s this possible? Actually, when you sweat, you lose a lot of water either through the summer heat or exercise thereby causing you to urinate less than normal. The more sweat you produce, the less urine you produce, thus allowing stone causing materials to remain in the body system and bond to the urinary tract and the kidney.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/why-fiber-is-essential-for-a-healthy-diet/">Why Fiber is Essential for a Healthy Diet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution: </strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drink enough water. One of the most potent days of dealing with replenishing excessive water loss through sweat is through water hydration. This way, you’ll get to urinate more frequently than when you don’t hydrate enough.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>The effects of oxalate-rich food</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of ingestible foods contain oxalates. Foods like peanuts, chocolate, rhubarb, beets, spinach as well as sweet potatoes are examples of food relatively rich in oxalates. Moderately eating these foods may be beneficial for people with calcium oxalate stones, the leading type of kidney stones. However, one major misconception is that the reduction of oxalate-rich foods will rescue the chance of calcium oxalate kidney stones. Theoretically, this might be correct but it isn’t from an overall health perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid oxalate kidney stones, make sure to eat oxalate-rich food alongside adequate calcium in every of your diet. This way, both calcium, and oxalate can bind together in the stomach and intestine before being processed to the kidney, hence giving a lower probability for kidney stones to be formed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Eat enough Calcium: </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the time when you see people talk about kidney stones, they often find a way to wrap it around calcium-rich food. They see it as the culprit in calcium-oxalate stones. But then, they are extremely wrong. Rather, a calcium-diet increases the risk of developing kidney stones.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to cut down on your intake of calcium. Rather, work towards reducing the sodium and oxalates in your diet. If you must eat oxalate-rich foods, make sure to pair it with calcium-rich food to reduce the effect of oxalates on the internal organs.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>One Kidney stone influences getting another</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A kidney stone experience is one heck of a painful one. You don’t get it once and for all. Rather you stand the risk of getting more. While a lot of people will do everything they can not to have it again, it is almost impossible for it not to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong>:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Act now! If you dont utilize the correct medication and take the right diet adjustment, you stand the risk of having the stones coming back, and this time it might even be worse and can result in more complex problems like kidney disease.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Kidney stones vary.</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from the common calcium oxalate times, another type of kidney stone is the uric acid stones. Usually, this type of stone can be gotten from red meat, organ meats, and shellfish owning to their natural chemical compound known as purines. The intake of purine in large quantities can result in higher production of uric acid which can lead to a larger acid load for the kidneys to purge out. The higher the excretion of uric acid, the lower the alkaline level of the overall urine, this making the urine more acidic. A more concentrated acidic urine is a major opening for uric acid stones to form easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other to prevent the formation of uric acid stones, it is important that you reduce the intake of food high on purine. The likes of organ meat, shellfish, and red meat should be cut down drastically. Thereafter, you’d have to choose more vegetative eating and eat more healthily.  Your diet should contain more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, as well as low-fat dairy products. More importantly, you have to cut down on how you drink sugar-sweetened foods and drinks, especially the ones with a high level of fructose corn syrup. As expected, you’d have to do away with alcoholic beverages and drinks as it has the potential of increasing the uric acid levels in the blood and avoid crash diets for the same reason. Disciplining against eating less animal-based protein and ingesting more fruits vegetables and fruits increases your chance of reducing stone formation while decreasing the acidity in the urine.</p>
