										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps you’re a science student reading this and you have no idea on how to write a lab report. No need to worry, you have the right article to help you out here. First of all, all lab reports have the same objective and that is, to document all findings and communicate to your audience its importance.</p>
<p>A lab report also has some basic fundamentals, which are: hypothesis, raw data, and all material listings. Once you know the basics, then you simply know what you’re doing. You can read more on the subject by clicking <a href="https://chiefessays.net/">here</a></p>
<h2>Parts of a Lab Report</h2>
<p>Although this might be different depending on specific instructions of your academic instructor. A typical lab report would consist of these parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Title page</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Methods and materials</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>References</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>Appendices</li>
</ol>
<h3>Title page:</h3>
<p>Not all reports have title pages, it depends solely on what your academic instructor wants. It’s a single page that contains; the name of the experiment, your name and the people you are working with, name of the academic instructor, and the date.</p>
<p>NB: follow all the instructions of your professor.</p>
<h3>Title:</h3>
<p>This deals more on the emphasis on the subject. It communicates to the reader the exact objective of the lab report.</p>
<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>It comprises of the overall summary and should not exceed 250 words. Should contain a brief on all analytical experiments as would be seen in the report.</p>
<p>NB: Do not have more than one paragraph carrying a lot of technicalities.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/short-preparation-debate-two-methods-for-developing-a-case/">Short Preparation Debate: Two Methods for Developing a Case</a></h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>This gives the reader a scientific introduction on the matter. In this part, you should offer the reader a broader context of the subject from findings in the experiment to the hypothesis. And a hypothesis is a practical and tested answer to an observation or scientific problem.</p>
<p>NB: Avoid giving conclusion here, background information and methods and materials.</p>
<h3>Methods and Materials:</h3>
<p>You have to give an accurate analysis of the methodology or procedures of acquiring your data. This is meant for others to use your method of the experiment for practice in the future. Make sure to give full details on how the experiment had been achieved. However, do avoid writing a step by step guide of your method and also remember that it is significant to clarify a series of actions as undertaken by you.</p>
<p>NB: Be detailed, copy all methods as found in the lab manual and use present tense when including results. In essence, make the reader hooked on how you made your findings; be in the shoes of a scientist that found something unknown.</p>
<h3>Results:</h3>
<p>In this part, all you have to do is to summarize your findings. That is, data and all trends or patterns, and also describe your views with statistical analysis and any type of representative cases. Do not compare your finding to other works. And also, do not discuss your mistakes. The results should simply apply in a logical order. This part of the lab report also contains data tables and graphs made during the experiment. Make sure to label all diagrams clearly and all units of measuring data should also be clearly written.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>This is a critical part of a lab report and must simply be authentic. It gives an indication of how the results of the experiment have been interpreted by you. For example, when discussing the quality of all measurements or data, the reader should be in the best position to make conclusions from your results. Basic questions, like “how fundamental is the result related to the hypothesis?” etc. could be asked in the mind of the reader when drawing out his or her conclusions.</p>
<h3>References:</h3>
<p>This is all references as cited in the lab report. An example is all sources of your data. Never include sources that were not cited in your lab report or text. And most times, the formatting of citations can vary from one department to another.</p>
<p>NB: Don’t think of assuming the kind of format, ask your professor.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This generally explains all the things learnt from the research and it’s regardless of whether your hypothesis was accepted or rejected. This part is quite significant because it gives the reader the assumption that your findings were all a success.</p>
<h3>Appendices:</h3>
<p>This is where to put more information that can be of more help to your reader. If you do wish to have appendices, always remember to make references to them once in a while in your text. Make sure to arrange all figures, tables and graphs by numbering them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The first rule to always observe when writing a lab report is to keep it detailed and short. Remember you’re not writing fiction but a non-fictional book, which entails going right to the subject matter.</p>
<p>And remember, to always take your lab-reports seriously because they play an important role in all laboratory courses in school, and most of the times can boost your CGPA. So follow all the brief, simple steps giving to you above, and also having the requirements as needed by your professor. With all these, you’ll surely have the best lab report in school. Good luck!</p>
