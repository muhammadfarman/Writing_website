										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to secure the job, position you desire, you must pay good attention to your letter of application. Having a good CV is important. But how do you ensure that your CV is actually read?  By simply writing an inviting letter of application. This is often where the shoe pinches for many.</p>
<p>Below are three stages that will help you create an effective letter of application.</p>
<h2><strong>Type of Letter of Application</strong></h2>
<p>An application letter should make your potential employer curious and motivate him/her to read your resume. This is rarely possible with a standard letter in which you always adjust a few words, depending on the job for which you are applying. Such a letter is impersonal and does not invite further reading.</p>
<p>Instead, write a customized letter for each application. To be successful with this, you can study the vacancy plus the company&#8217;s website. Then find similarities with your experience and skills, and start writing based on this information. You will receive a letter in which the employer recognizes his vacancy and company, where your strengths are briefly mentioned. That makes you curious and motivates you to continue reading. Make good use of this stage.</p>
<h2><strong>Write in a Way That Draws the Interest of an Employer</strong></h2>
<p>Now that you already know the kind of letter to write, it&#8217;s time to write your intro and closure. Avoid using regular intros and closures. Some of these sound like: &#8221; I saw your vacancy for&#8230;. on XYZ site&#8221; and &#8220;I would like to explain my motivation in a personal interview.&#8221; Whoever starts and ends with an original sentence arouses more interest from employers.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/steps-involved-in-writing-a-winning-business-proposal/">How to Write a Professional Press Release</a></h2>
<p>To stand out, come up with original intros and closures. This is easier if you use your own words. A good example of a creative opener is: &#8220;Why won&#8217;t this candidate end up in this organization? I am happy to explain this to you!&#8221; Here is a distinguished conclusion: &#8220;A personal conversation is the best way to get to know each other better. Can I count on an invitation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, you write a letter of application to accompany your CV. A recruiter looks at your application letter with certain questions in mind. In it, he/she looks for answers to the following questions: &#8220;What are you bringing to the organization?&#8221; and &#8220;Why should we invite you?&#8221; Make sure you answer these questions here, after your catchy intro.</p>
<h2><strong>Checking for Typing and Spelling Errors</strong></h2>
<p>As we have established above, your letter of application is the first thing your employer sees. It goes without saying that spelling mistakes are real turnoffs. Fortunately, there are sufficient tools today to produce error-free letters, even if you are not gifted with great writing skills.</p>
<p>Always turn on the spelling checker of your writing program while writing your letter. In Word Document, you will find this function at the far left, under the &#8216;Check&#8217; tab. Proofread your letter by yourself, then have it read by someone else, preferably a professional proofreader.</p>
<h2><strong>What does not belong in your cover letter?</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Just as what you include in your letter of application counts, there is also information that you should leave out. Because it does not belong in your letter or because it ensures that a letter with this information is taken less seriously. Below is some information you shouldn&#8217;t include in your letter of application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements or conditions under which you would take the job.</li>
<li>That you are new to the position.</li>
<li>Lots of background information about your life and family issues.</li>
<li>References (this section is for your CV).</li>
<li>A repeat of your affairs from your resume.</li>
<li>Negative experiences with previous employers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the simple steps discussed in this article will make your letter of application appealing to your potential employer. Here are some <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/application-letter-template-2061568">application letter templates</a> you can use.</p>
