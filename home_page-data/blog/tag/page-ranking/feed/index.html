										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you eyeing a particular keyword and looking to integrate it into your page? Or you probably want to see your website page ranking well on a search engine? Well, you’ve got to be prepared for it. The journey isn’t an easy one, but it is achievable.</p>
<p>As you already know, organic keyword ranking is a continuous process. Although you won’t get your desired results always, once you are able to commit to content optimization and marketing, then you can make things happen.</p>
<p>On this note, let’s delve into 10 steps to ranking a keyword optimally for your webpage.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>A formidable foundation for your page ranking</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Somehow, this is more of a pre-step before the actual step. You really have to put some basics in place before you can consider ranking for any keyword. Some of the things you need to do are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reputable platform –  How long a website has been around matters. More so, how much you’ve been able to accrue authority and links is the major key to launch SEO best practices.</li>
<li>Reliable network – To efficiently rank a keyword, your network is very much important. How much audience does your content draw? How much influence are you able to draw from social media? Is your email marketing bringing you the much-needed contacts? Once you’re able to create a credible network, then you’d have succeeded in building a worthy relationship for your page to rank well. It’s only the basics though and you have to take your time to do it right.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Research your initial keyword</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t assume you know your targeted keyword. It will kill your page. Rather, take the time to search the keywords while comparing and contrasting as many tools as possible.  Only then can you decipher the search volume for the keyword and competition abound before finalizing on your chosen keyword.  Here are some of the things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good volume is good enough – While you don’t want to go for a keyword with a relative search volume, you wouldn’t just have to settle for one that is very popular. That said, you should take time to study whether the high-ranking keyword has any relevance with your website and not too difficult to comprehend.</li>
<li>Go for related business model keywords – Your website is more likely to succeed in keyword ranking only if the chosen keyword is relevant to the platform.  Even with that, you have to ensure that the chosen keyword is valuable enough for any irrelevancy either for the page or the audience involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>To further help, you should compile a list of close variations on your primary keywords. They would enable you to make a choice and optimize your content.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Look out for possible competitors</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hurray! You finally decided on a keyword. But that not all. Take the time to search through and see how other related platforms as you are doing. Check out for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domains and URLs – Are there any high-ranking URLs with your chosen keyword? How many are precise match domains?</li>
<li>Titles – How does the title tag? Do they include the keyword?</li>
<li>The ranking content – Are they product reviews, blog posts or videos?</li>
<li>Types of businesses being ranked– Are they upcoming or big brands?</li>
<li>What are your competitors’ authoritative strengths?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although you’re looking out to stand uniquely-tall among your others, you, however, have to look out for how other competitors are doing to beat them to their game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>What are your intentions towards your page ranking? </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The specificity of the keyword gives it a better gauge for potential searchers to look out for. Apparently, the intent of the keyword is what prompts researchers’ accessibility. You need to understand that some researchers would rather go for a keyword of the search query they really want.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Envisage the Content</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next thing to do is map out the content that will actually help your rank. As you already know, there are lots of available options to help your keyword rank. Some of them include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog post</li>
<li>Product page</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>An index or directory of links</li>
<li>An authoritative guide, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, how long it will take you to create content as well as who’d create it is very important.  Do you have the budget and resources to run the content? Regardless of your resources, you possess the capacity to create content. While infographics and videos might cost you more, text articles and blogs would cost you less.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong>Execute </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>None of the aforementioned steps actualize unless they are executed. But more importantly, you don’t have to rush it. Take your time to make keyword researches and churn out worthy content that will sell it out.  Take note, it isn&#8217;t to have a search engine optimized content but with the right keyword and properly structured content, you’re set there.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong>Analyze properly if you want unique page ranking</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, now that you’ve launched your content with your fully-optimized keyword, you’re almost done. But not done yet.  The internet of space is a living means and it is never too late to optimize your content. Manually check how your keyword ranks ( there are lots of ranking tools available online) and make sure you’re not seeing personalized results. Utilize analytics to decode the keyword that your content is ranking for. They might be for initial content and not the original one you planned. Although this is a welcome development, it actually would be better if your plan goes accordingly. If it doesn’t go consequently as you wanted, then theirs is more work for you to do.</p>
<p>Here’s what to consider:</p>
<p>Is your keyword properly optimized for your page ranking?</p>
<p>Is it visible?</p>
<p>What else can you add to make it sell out?</p>
<p>Once you’re able to find solutions to the above questions, you are definitely going to begin seeing results soon enough.</p>
