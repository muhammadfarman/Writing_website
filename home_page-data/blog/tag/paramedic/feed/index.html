										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The popularity of these medics has been growing quite considerably throughout the century. Now before we go into the major points of this topic, I’ll like to explain “who is a Paramedic?” A paramedic is a trained and skilled medical expert who has been instructed on general specifics, to carry out the duties of a medical doctor, especially in times of an emergency. They can do almost everything that a physician can do to his or her patient. That is, they can make a diagnosis on the spot. Paramedics can evaluate and treat patients. They do so medications and equipment that can be found in the emergency unit of a hospital.</p>
<p>Paramedics are typically found in the emergency care unit of a hospital, ambulances or rapid emergency response vehicles.  There are various job opportunities for paramedics. You can find such demands in cruise ship medical departments, helicopter dispatch units, hyperbaric oxygen chambers and off-shore drilling platform. It is with accurate observation to say that paramedics are much demanded all over the world.</p>
<p>The word  “paramedic,” denotes personnel who functions as an extension of the doctor or physician. A paramedic can be illustrated as a doctor on the move. He does absolutely everything a doctor or a physician does. That is the medical prescriptions and procedures. It can come through direct intervention on a matter at hand, radio, pre-established written orders, and telephone.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/causes-and-types-of-seizures-in-infants/">Causes and types of Seizures in Infants</a></h2>
<p>The characters of a paramedic are; they are calm, honest, intelligent, ambitious, caring, non-judgmental, and reliable. They are people who are both strong either physically or mentally. These are some of the attributes that are sought in a paramedic.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is a paramedic a nurse or an assistant?</h3>
<p>No. They’re a unique medical entity under the body of the medical association of each country. They receive the same knowledge as a physician or nurse. But at some particular courses in progression in their respective universities. They specialise in something that relates to immediate emergency response methods. Sometimes they can be called upon to fill up a role. That is, especially when the country or an area is in some form of crises. So to sum it up, a paramedic is partly a social worker, clergy, mediator, teacher, physician and nurse.</p>
<h3>How independent is a paramedic?</h3>
<p>He or she isn’t independent in any way. He is sometimes designated as a “Delegated practitioner.”  He or she must receive the authorised permit or license to proceed with any diagnoses or treatment whatsoever. Each practising paramedic has a tutor or an instructor, who is also a medical director. He or she is responsible for giving instructions to the paramedics and making sure all equipment’s, medications and procedures to be applied in treatment are all set and ready. Without which, the paramedics have no freedom to do anything.</p>
<h3>As a physician or a nurse, can I work as a paramedic under the emergency care unit?</h3>
<p>You can’t. Various countries have their guidelines to recruit paramedics. In some countries, you’ll have to earn a paramedic degree of some sort or earn a license to perform such duties. So check your country and follow the principles or guidelines, if you wish to be a paramedic.</p>
<h3>The significance of Paramedics in society</h3>
<ul>
<li>They are life-savers in critical conditions of a victim.</li>
<li>Paramedics are always available 24/7 around your neighbourhood.</li>
<li>They are quick-thinkers, so as to know what happens to their victims in sudden conditions.</li>
<li>Paramedics well trained to handle situations that could seem traumatic.</li>
<li>They are always trained to be right on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in essence, a paramedic is a person who is here for you. They’re generally service providers. They help the community they are either posted to or where they are residing.</p>
