										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pharmacist helps patients prescribe medications for treatment and how to use them. He/she also gives patients professional advice for living a healthy lifestyle, gives immunizations, and conduct general health screening. With the aim of pharmaceuticals to help patients manage pain, prevent disease, and treat all sorts of illnesses and symptoms, new drugs are always developed. The services of pharmacists are often needed. They must always stay up-to-date with new therapies and the functions they have in the body. It is also important that pharmacists understand how these new therapies interact with food and other drugs.</p>
<p>It was recently agreed by researchers with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that pharmacists often perform several tasks while they work &#8211; despite the professional diversity.</p>
<p>Below are some key responsibilities of a pharmacist.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of Pharmacist</h2>
<h3>They Offer Prescriptions</h3>
<p>This is what often comes to the mind of most people when they hear about a pharmacist, counting out tablets or capsules, giving drugs to patients, and also making a bottle label. Pharmacists dispense prescriptions to patients.</p>
<h3>They Counsels Patients</h3>
<p>The counseling is more than simply informing the patient&#8217;s adverse reactions or interactions of drugs and food and other beverages such as juice from grapes. It includes showing patients how and when doses should be used as well as giving patients follow-up service. It also entails that pharmacists share tips on how the side effects of a medication can be reduced while benefiting from it. The counseling offered here can be numerous.</p>
<h3>Give Patients Safety</h3>
<p>A pharmacist is often concerned about the safety of patients. He/she examines every medical record of patients. This is done every time there is a new prescription. This act prevents any form of potential dangerous interaction between different medications.</p>

<h3>Helps Patients Improve General Health</h3>
<p>For one to maintain good health, it goes beyond taking drug prescriptions. A pharmacist helps a patient heal faster and also helps in preventing diseases by giving advice and remedies aside from drug prescriptions. Such advice for general health may include the use of herbal and natural products, taking good diets, and regular exercise.</p>
<h3>Partners with Insurance Companies</h3>
<p>This role is important. Some pharmacists work in independent and chain pharmacies. This means they need to have insurance claims, and also privately working with insurance companies, to resolve coverage denial and also ensure payment of Medicare.</p>
<h3>Close Relationship with Prescribers</h3>
<p>Pharmacists often communicate with prescribers. In case a prescription order is perceived to be harmful to a patient, formulation and dosage need to be confirmed. Again, you need to check if a brand name is required or if it can be substituted with a generic equivalent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Management of Staff</h3>
<p>This is one of the overall responsibilities of a pharmacist. He/she is to maintain the 3 Rs; right drug/medication, the right patient, and the right dose. To do this, pharmacists must oversee and monitor the works of residents, student interns, and pharmacy technicians. Supervisors and owners of pharmacies are also responsible for hiring decisions, as well as creating workplace policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>They do Administrative Works</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of a pharmacist to regularly keep patient&#8217;s files, and make sure that products needed are in stock. There is also a need for reports to be gathered and filed. Holding a management position can make you spend more time on administrative activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Educating Other Health Providers</h3>
<p>Pharmacists often educate other health practitioners about new protocols regarding medications and therapies.</p>
<p>They also have running educational courses in order to renew their licenses and to be updated on certain drug approvals. While doing all these, they must comply with all federal and state laws regulating the pharmacy industry.</p>
<p>These are some of the important responsibilities of pharmacists. You can learn more <a href="https://www.truity.com/career-profile/pharmacist">here</a>.</p>
