										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you experience some sort of discomfort in your body system, the best thing you have to do is to report to your doctor and do physical therapy. When running the physical therapy, you can share the information about how you feel and see whether the doctor can proffer medication to help you out.</p>
<p>At some point, these medications work. And sometimes, they don’t. Now you become bothered as to what could be the reasons why you are not getting better. Even then, you opt to go for a complete scan and checkup to ascertain what could be wrong with you but the results come back negative. You are perfectly alright. But you know you are not. What could be wrong with you? Why are you still feeling the discomfort in your body system even when the test and scan prove otherwise? Not even the administered medications are working?</p>
<p>Without any doubt, all of these thoughts must definitely occupy your mind. You feel upset since you’re not in any way closer to identifying what the problem is. But you’ve got your ever-qualified doctor urging you to stay calm. He wants to refer you to a physical therapist.  He wants to book you an appointment to meet another “medical practitioner.”</p>
<p>What? You don’t seem to like the sound of that, do you? Your major scare is that you don’t know how it would feel like. If you had your way, you’d leave it and not continue with the therapy.</p>

<p>But you’re wrong. Physical therapy isn’t as complex or wrong as you seem to visualize it. Rather, it is one of the best things that can happen to your health. Yet, the news doesn’t come that bountifully. You want a specific break down. Well, we’ve got that for you. Let’s deal with it, one step at a time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>First, what is physical therapy? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a simple definition, we&#8217;d define physical therapy as a kind of medical solution that doesn’t require you to take medications or undergo surgery. But then, it is a treatment for “ailing” patients.</p>
<p>How’s that even possible? Well, in physical therapy, the therapist examines the patient and creates a treatment technique plan to enhance or better still, deal with the discomfort in the body system. What this means is that PT ( as we&#8217;ll be referring to physical therapy for the most part of this article) utilizes a system to adequately improve the life of the individual involved and potentially bring down ailing symptoms.</p>
<p>And just as the fingers on our hands differ, there are a lot of disparities as to why people visit therapists. While it is a recovery process for some, to others, it is a balancing process to perfect healing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>How can physical therapy help you?</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s navigate to the next part since you already know what physical therapy is all about? How can it help you?</p>
<p>Well, just like it is stipulated in the definition, physical therapy is a healing process for people suffering from different medical conditions. For clarification purpose, here are few people that are eligible to apply for physical therapy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sport injuries</li>
<li>Balance and Walking problems</li>
<li>Age-related issues</li>
<li>Neurological problems</li>
<li>Heart and Lung diseases.</li>
<li>Cancer patients and many other patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, regardless of what your health issue is, PT has got something to get back on track in no time.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>How does a Physical Therapist treats me since there are no medications or surgeries? </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, physical therapists are professional observers. They can see right through you even before conducting a test or running a scan on you. Their major obligation is to get to the root of your discomfort. This is to say,  they are not just like your regular doctors, they are way more than that. They have amassed an advanced level of education to enable them to operate as they are.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if there’s a need to transfer your case to medical doctor or surgeon, they’d be the first to know and make sure that they follow you to the latter and make sure that they find a cure to your sickness. Yet, more than just treat your symptoms, physical therapists make sure to discuss your daily activities and how to prevent further occurrence(s).</p>
<h2><strong>What goes on in a physical therapy session?</strong></h2>
<p>Usually, a  physical therapy session doesn’t exceed  45–60 minutes. However, during your primary session, here are some things you should expect;</p>
<p><strong>Medical History Review</strong>: Although it is very likely that your therapist already has your medical background, he or she might still have to discuss it with you in detail. This will ensure that there isn’t a mix-up or problems in determining your present problem.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Examination</strong>: Just like every medical practitioner, your therapist will have to conduct a test in you. He will have to check out every part of your body and be certain that you have the necessary flexibility and balance. You may need to engage in some activities to determine this anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Plan</strong>: Unlike many other treatments, PT isn’t a one-time thing. Rather, it is a continuous treatment that your therapist must have developed to make sure you’re good to go in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment</strong>: Depending on the plan you’re on, you may have to engage in some extra-curricular activities at home, which you must have to balance and report back to your therapist to ensure that you’re recovering.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Physical therapy ensures that you get the best of treatment to put in the right place. With it, you can bid the world of discomfort and pain in no time.</p>
