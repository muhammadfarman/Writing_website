										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The voice is designed specifically for singing, shouting, laughing, crying, and talking; amongst many attributes. It is the human sound and the ability to make reasonable sounds and outstanding speeches makes us unique in contrast to other lower animals. Also, it is important to know that without an idea, preparation and a platform, the voice can never be heard; mostly in this digital age.  And on this note, we would be introducing all you need to know about powerpoint presentation and creating outstanding speeches.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a powerpoint presentation?</strong></h2>
<p>Powerpoint is Microsoft software designed to contain individual slides used for teleconferencing, business meetings, academic purposes, and training. It often begins with a title page that accommodates the name of the presenter, the title of the presentation followed by the content slides, and finally a concluding slide. The information slides are usually concise points arranged in the bullet form with little to zero stories; no need for history lessons here.  It also contains graphs, charts, videos, photos, screenshot, diagrams, and animations options asides the text form. The powerpoint package has been proven to be the easiest form of presentation since the advent of technology.</p>

<h2><strong>How to interact effectively with the powerpoint presentation</strong></h2>
<p>Most persons find it difficult to present in the public; even worse; to present digitally. Maybe, it is wise to conclude that the fear of presenting is as a result of the many eyes staring but on the other hand though it can be as a result of digital phobia or lack of preparations from the presenter. Howbeit, in this piece, we would be highlighting the many ways to give unique speeches with a powerpoint presentation and ways to interact effectively with the audiences and they listed below:</p>
<h2><strong>Know your audience and target your presentation at them</strong></h2>
<p>The first and the most important step of the presentation are to know your target audience. One has to make a thorough research on the group of persons to speak to; since no one wants an embarrassing moment.  Let powerpoint presentation on health-related issues; be prepared for health practitioners and that which is meant for the financial institutions; be prepared for the said purpose.  For a successful presentation, let the topic be specifically customized and relevant to the professions, training, meetings, and academies.</p>
<h2><strong>Map out an outline</strong></h2>
<p>This point is not just meant for powerpoint presentation; but for all presentations; jot down outlines, write down points and objectives of a meeting even if you are speaking to a handful of audience. Be sure to start with an outline that is relevant to the people; it is efficient and quick. However, remember not to bombard them with material overload as it can be overwhelming.</p>
<h2><strong>Make use of a professional powerpoint presentation template</strong></h2>
<p>Since you would be talking to different professionals from all works of life, it is wise to scrap conventional powerpoint templates and make use of the premium ones. This, however, comes with a monthly subscription but the good thing is; you would have unlimited access to the many creative templates it offers.</p>
<h2><strong>Make slides short</strong></h2>
<p>To create an outstanding speech with a powerpoint presentation, it is important to keep your slides as short as possible with the cogent point listed. When a point is overemphasized for a longer period, the audience tends to lose interest. Therefore, keep your data and facts short and realistic.</p>
<h2><strong>Prepare for the presentation</strong></h2>
<p>No law says over-preparation is a crime. If you want to be a great speaker, then practice and practice over time. Practice in the front of your mirror or rehearse the lines and slides with a person you are most comfortable with; a person who would correct you if need be; with no sentiments or judgments’ whatsoever.</p>
<h2><strong>In conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Being a unique speaker requires effort; it doesn&#8217;t just happen overnight. You need to be consistent with it and most of all evolve and learn new ways of doing it effortlessly. Don&#8217;t forget, as we grow, the tech world grows also. Therefore, be thirsty to learn more complex ways of handling the powerpoint presentation.</p>
