										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, over a quarter of the total baby births stories in the United States of America, and the world at large experienced birth defect. While some are minor and do not require any major medical treatment, others are very complicated and might result in serious health complications and could require surgery to correct. Let&#8217;s talk about birth defects in children</p>
<h2><strong>But what exactly are birth defects in children? </strong></h2>
<p>Simply put, birth defects in children are health conditions that happen before or after childbirth.  It could either be psychological, physical, or medical.</p>
<p>A recent study deduced that there are over  4,000 types of birth defects in children, hence making it challenging to affirm what exactly is a birth defect to other health conditions. Highlighted below are some of child defects issues:</p>
<p>Down syndrome</p>
<p>Cleft lip or palate</p>
<p>Cerebral palsy</p>
<p>Congenital heart defects</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-order-a-paper-in-writing-errands/">How to order a paper in writing errands.</a></h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome</p>
<p>Spina bifida</p>
<p>Upper and lower limb reduction defects</p>
<p>Club foot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Causes of Birth Defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Medical-wise, there are lots of factors that could result in birth defects in children. To put it mildly, it could result from genetic problems, environment, ingestion or even personal behaviors. Generally, a detectable birth defect is usually environmental, which might be as a result of the pregnant mother&#8217;s exposure to chemicals or problems with the genre of the baby.</p>
<p>Notable medical researches have proven that the following conditions and activities can influence the chance of birth defects during pregnancy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking certain medications</li>
<li>Smoking or dealing in drugs</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Certain medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity.</li>
</ul>
<p>As aforementioned, these are only a few activities and conditions that could lead to childbirth defects. There could be more than a thousand and one other reasons out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Preventing birth defects in children</strong></h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are remedial steps that can be taken to curtail birth defects during pregnancy. Should it be followed strictly, there is every chance that the pregnant mother will give birth without any form of defects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Visiting competent health care providers</strong>:</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon discovering that you’re pregnant,  your next shot should be how to schedule your session with your health care provider. The potentials of staying healthier are more when you register for ante-natal care with competent health care practitioners. Whilst you’ve gotten attended to, you should take the time to talk about every activity, medication, and complications you might be having with your doctor. This way, your gynecologist can put you through the necessities that would preferably put you on the high.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Vaccination matters: </strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One important factor that you greatly consider when having your appointment with your doctor is vaccination. You cannot underemphasize the importance one bit. Being vaccinated against flu and other sicknesses would go a long way to make sure that your pregnancy is healthy and you have a safe childbirth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Dealing with pre-existing conditions</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to take care of pre-existing health conditions before getting pregnant. Don’t get this wrong. You do have the right to be pregnant whenever you want to so long as you have the all-round means to take care of a child. But then, you should consider the future of the child and not subject him/her to pains or discomfort. Even you, you deserve painless childbirth. Hence, you have to take care of any conditions that can hinder you from this happiness. A good example of problems you have to deal with is diabetes and obesity. These two have a high potential of badly affecting childbirth. Take every precaution you can so you can be on a high every time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Folic Acid is important</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under every circumstance, a pregnant woman should ingest 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Even so, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get prepared before the said time. With the constant taking of prenatal supplements and multivitamins, you should be able to get enough folic acid sustenance to last you for a while.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>A foreign substance is a no-no</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a pregnant woman, you don’t have any business engaging in smoking, taking hard drugs or alcohol. Aside from pregnancy, these habits are injurious to health. And since you have another “flexible” life in you to worry about, you really should do away with it totally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Family History and healthy living</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even without being told, healthy living is essential to living well. However, with pregnancy now in the picture, it can help deal with birth defects. Eating healthy and engaging in healthy activities would go a long way to making your baby healthy.</p>
<p>Also, in the case that your family has a history of defects during childbirth, then this is the right time to discuss it with your doctor.  Your gynecologist can refer you to a genetic counselor or therapist that will help determine the potential of your child being not with a defect or not.</p>
<p>However, even after prenatal testing and you know that your baby has the potential of being born with a defect, then you really shouldn’t be worried or be sick over it.  You’re not alone in this quest. There are laid down programs to support pregnant women with possible childbirth defects. Simply enroll in one and get familiar with what to expect until, when and after your baby arrives. You, your baby and family will appreciate you for that.</p>
