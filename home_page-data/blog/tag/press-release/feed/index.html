										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is an important moment for every entrepreneur: when the <strong>press release</strong> about your new company, service or product is about to be written and sent out. Writing a good press release is one. However, writing a professional press release that results in media publication is a different matter. So how do you write and send a good press release? Â This is exactly what this article will address. The tips discussed below will help you write a professional press release. Enjoy!</p>
<h2><strong>The News at The Top</strong></h2>
<p>Begin your <strong>press release</strong> with the most important news summarized in a short lead of a few sentences. It often happens that the &#8216;main&#8217; news is hidden somewhere in the middle of the press release. Also, don&#8217;t forget to mention important information by checking whether you have answered the classic list of questions: who? what? true? when? why? and how? This is crucial.</p>
<h2><strong>Create Clear Subject Line and Heading in your press release</strong></h2>
<p>Begin the subject line of your mail with &#8220;Press release:&#8221; followed by a good header, so that the goal is immediately clear. Put the news briefly in the title of your mail. Leave out unnecessary words as much as possible &#8211; the shorter the better. There are still regular press releases with the subject only &#8216;Message for editors&#8217; or &#8216;Press release&#8217;. Don&#8217;t your misleading or funny intended headlines for your press release.</p>
<h2><strong>It Must be News</strong></h2>
<p>You can just send out any kind of content &#8211; it&#8217;s all about what&#8217;s new. There must be news to report. The irritation about the overkill of press releases from your company can have a negative effect. For example, when next you have an important announcement, it will no longer be included. So, pay attention to the type of content you want to write.</p>
<h2><strong>Use the Text of the E-mail</strong></h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t ever send an email with the press release as an attachment. Journalists/Editors hate that. The best way is to always include the bare text of the press release in the e-mail body itself, even if you add a well-designed PDF version.</p>

<p>Colored fonts or colored background in the mail are also disturbing and are not easy to read for a color-blind journalist. A logo and a certain layout in the mail is not necessary when sending out your press release. Editors must be able to scan many texts quickly, without obstacles.</p>
<h2><strong>Adjust the Recipients Per Subject</strong></h2>
<p>Decide which journalists and media you can best send your press release to, then adjust the recipients per subject. For journalists you already know well, you can send a personal email about the news in advance. If you want to keep your relationship with them well, they would like to have your press release for the crowd.</p>
<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t Use Marketing Language and Jargons when writing a professional press release</strong></h2>
<p>Whenever you are creating a professional press release, avoid using too much sales language and terms. Not all journalists are aware of the terms used in some fields. Here, the marketing language is completely taboo. If your product or service is so &#8220;valuable&#8221;, &#8220;innovative&#8221;, and &#8220;unique&#8221;, then that must be clear from the rest of the message &#8211; you can omit these words. And if you still dare to claim that something is innovative, prove that immediately, backing it up with points. For example, by telling what makes a product different or what exactly is new about it.</p>
<h2><strong>Address Journalists with the Right Tone</strong></h2>
<p>This is a fact you must always consider when writing a professional press release: free publicity is a favor. You should always speak to journalists in a friendly way. They are helping you to promote your business, so be polite in your approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the tips above, your <strong>press release</strong> should easily get your desired result. Also, don&#8217;t forget to always end it with as many contact details as possible. There may be vital questions journalists will want to ask.</p>
