										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is a reaction paper? Do you believe that many scholars find this term difficult to define and yes, why not! Most scholars only come across this paper a few times in their academic pursuits.</p>
<p>A reaction paper isn’t too technical, it’s still the same with the English word to “react”. You do know that for every action taken there is always a reaction. This is exactly what the examiner wants you to do when he gives you a literary story, he simply wants you to react and give your personal suggestions on the subject.</p>
<p>So in simple terms, a reaction paper is explained as the literary response towards a story. Before you begin, you’ll have to, analyze the book and get all the necessary information you need before giving an opinion on the matter. So the key thing when writing a reaction paper is “giving a suggestion on the matter.” All you have to do is to have followers, who will support your suggestion.</p>
<p>There’re two common basic fundamentals when writing a reaction paper, in which it comprises of two audiences, and they’re the readers and the referees.</p>
<p>The readers are those who read your work and the referee are those who decide what to post. It is also common to find your work as a reference by other writers who are working on the same subject. Check out these tips <a href="http://www.aresearchguide.com/">here</a>, you might find it very helpful</p>
<h2>Steps to writing a research paper</h2>
<p>Before writing on any subject, and if you’re done reading the book. The first thing to ask yourself is “what is my take on this subject, how do I feel after reading this book?” you definitely have to know what the writer was trying to pass across.</p>
<p>Your presentation also matters because this can give you a high score when graded by your examiner. Here is a guide that would be very helpful for you when organizing a reaction paper:</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-write-a-professional-case-study/">Article Review Writing: The Preparation and Process Involved</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: This deals with giving a brief background of the story. This helps to introduce the subject to the reader and guides the reader throughout the work.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The first question on every reader&#8217;s mind would be “why review this work?” with such questions, you need to make them interested in reading your work by creating suspense.</li>
<li><strong>Thesis</strong>: Include a thesis statement when presenting or introducing your work. A thesis generally includes a summary of the work.</li>
<li><strong>Specific details of the book</strong>: This deals with giving basic details of the book, like for example; the author, and what the book is all about.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Outline of a Reaction Paper</h2>
<p>To have superb content for the book you are analyzing, you have to follow these processes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read or watch the movie</strong>: All you have to do here is to jot down the main points while watching or reading the book. For a book, you’ll have to read two times to become more acquainted with the theme of the book.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Read the question of your examiner and make sure you’re following. Perhaps you may be asked to react to a part of the story, this, therefore, means you have to center your suggestions to that particular section. The second question by your examiner may be to give a detailed explanation of the opinion of the writer. To answer such a question, you’ll have to center on the writer&#8217;s thoughts as relating to his or her book.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reaction paper format</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Make sure the introduction captures the interest of the reader. In this part, you’ll have to describe the writer, the subject matter of the story and the general idea. A good introduction should have two to four sentences. And immediately after this, you write the thesis statement, which must also be short and precise.</li>
<li><strong>Body</strong>: This is where all the ideas as gotten from the book are written. In each paragraph, you should begin each one with a topic sentence. The topic sentence should deal mainly with passing across the information and also include the appropriate authorities on a subject or source to back up your suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this part of the paper, you should link your thesis statement with all the summary of ideas in each paragraph. A good way to end the reaction paper is by hitting the main points when making a clarification.</li>
<li><strong>Citations</strong>: You need to give credit to either the writer or any other source. This, therefore, includes, citing the sources you may have used in your reaction paper.</li>
</ol>
