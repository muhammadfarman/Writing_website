										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One top priority that the educational system and healthcare system should consider is the health and safety of children in the school. School nurses have important roles in providing comprehensive health care to youths in schools. They specialize in advance nursing that focuses on students&#8217; well-being, which leads to good health and academic success.</p>
<p>This article describes the roles of school nurses as a team, rendering preventive services, intervention if possible health problems to foster the educational success of students.</p>
<h2>Roles of School Nurses</h2>
<h2>Improving Healthcare Quality</h2>
<p>This is a continuous process that is systematically conducted. It leads to improvements that are easily measured. In continuous quality improvement, the nursing process is active. Some of the actions that go with this process include general assessment, identifying an issue, coming up with an action plan, implementing the plan, and examining the final outcome. In this process, the school nurse is responsible for the collection of data.</p>
<h2>Initiating useful Health Policies</h2>
<p>The school nurses play a key role in developing programs, procedures, and policies that provide good health services to schools. To achieve this aim, they rely on practical evidence and performance data that are focused on the students.</p>

<p>They include provisions that are ethical into different segments of practice. The school nurses lead in the delivery of care protecting students, privacy, dignity, and other rights that are open to diversifying the school setting.</p>
<p>They support individual students. Therefore they make sure that education and skills that promote problem-solving, self-development, collaboration with peers, and effective communication are given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They Coordinate Healthcare</h2>
<p>Because the school nurses are members of both nursing/medical and education, it is very easy for them to collaborate and community with practitioners of these two fields. They are also case managers. This allows them to be able to coordinate the healthcare of students, relating to medical home, school, and family.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it is the role of a school nurse t create, updates, and implement Individualized Healthcare Plans. A typical school nurse can provide healthcare required to develop a student&#8217;s health for promoting effective learning &#8211; being a key member of other interdisciplinary teams.</p>
<p>As a school nurse provides quality healthcare, he/she also intervene in potential health challenges that may occur. Students get direct care &#8211; ranging from routine treatments and procedures, and medical administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They Provide Community Health</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not only the school students that benefit from what the school nurses have to offer. A community can also benefit. As school nursing covers community/public health, the health of a community is promoted. The school nurses also play a key role in the prevention of diseases that may affect the community. This role is easier to play as they use cultural competency to deliver good care &#8211; especially in communities with diverse cultures.</p>
<p>Also, they make use of primary prevention. The school nurses provide health education that boosts both mental and physical health. They also help in making healthcare decisions as well as the prevention of diseases. Both the public and the school benefit from this role.</p>
<p>By controlling infectious diseases around the school environment, the school nurses offer safety. They promote vaccines and use infection control measures for schools. They also provide disease surveillance and reporting service. These are based on their standards of practice.</p>
<p>Students and families also benefit from the health equity the school nurses promote. They enjoy financial resources, food, shelter, and healthcare services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what was discussed above, it is clear how school nurses play an important role in the safety and health of children in schools, promoting quality learning. As a member of professional nursing, they are the major providers of healthcare in school settings.</p>
