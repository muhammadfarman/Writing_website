										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>short preparation debate</strong> often requires limited time to prepare for presentations. Two teams get a topic 30 to 90 minutes before the debate commence. A key difference between this type of debate and the traditional regular one is simply the time limitation for preparation. The style is the same.</p>
<h2><strong>Steps Involved when Preparing for a Short Preparation Debate</strong></h2>
<p>Below are two methods you can choose from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Method one</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Â </strong><strong>Preparing a Case with Individual Ideas</strong></p>
<p>Here, everyone in a team will create a full case. When this is done, there will be collaboration. Before you use this method, decide whether it will fit the team and the topic to debate.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose a Team Leader</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the timekeeper during your preparation. He or she is to make final decisions regarding arguments and definitions.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Individual Brainstorming</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The whole case should be quickly outlined by each of your team members. Ideas will be put to work doing this. Also, the initial thinking process flows easily. Your team can create definitions at this moment. Facts can also be quickly gathered.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Sharing of Cases</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This should take less than 10 minutes. Members of your team are to share their outline, from step one. When sharing cases, it should be brief. More details can be added later.</p>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/how-to-write-a-unique-book-review/">Article Review Writing: The Preparation and Process Involved</a></h2>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Team&#8217;s General Case</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the step to develop the general case of your team. Begin with a blank paper. The creation of the case should be done together with all team members. Include some ideas already brainstormed. Highlight crucial elements of in the case &#8211; key points for members to use.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Speech Writing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, your team&#8217;s work can be used to create individual speeches. Also, add those parts specific to various speaking roles.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Concluding Your Work</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You are to revise and review at this point. This is where a team gathers, and all members are to summarize their speeches. Review for any weakness that may occur during the arguments. Talk about how it will be tackled. Each member must be reminded of his or her path to debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Method Two</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Creating the Case Together</strong></h3>
<p>With this method, you need to first work alone, have a discussion as a group, and finally work individually again.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><strong>Assign a Group Leader</strong></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The group leader will make all final decisions, just as the first method.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Analysis of the Topic</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>On an independent level, members in your team should brainstorm in order to develop the argument of the team. A good strategy for brainstorming is to examine the view of some intelligent people about the topic to talk about. Again, consider how your group will present the case, both in convincing an argument and possible counter-arguments.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Talk About the Topic</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>At this stage, your group have to discuss the results from the brainstorming session. An agreement on how to interpret your topic must be discussed. Also, talk about how the general case will be argued, plus what research to include.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Preparation of Individual Speeches</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This should take less than 15 minutes of your time. First of all, engaging speeches should be prepared the first and second members to present. Backing up your statements with research is a plus. Your opponent(s) may come up with strong arguments, therefore, your third speaker needs to look deeper into a case that may arise. Also, don&#8217;t forget to consider a possible weakness the other team may spot from your argument&#8217;s points. Be ready to defend it accordingly.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Team Discussion of Speeches</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This should be brief. Your group should talk about the points, plus some new insights that are gotten while writing. If new ideas are discovered, be clear on how they can fit arguments that would be presented by the first and second speakers.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Revise and Review</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the last step of this method. You have a few minutes left. Clean up the case, both the outline and the main arguments.</p>
