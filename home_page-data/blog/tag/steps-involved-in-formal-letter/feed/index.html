										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first step is to know how to format your letter. And you can do that by clicking <a href="http://www.ukpostbox.com/">here</a> to find good samples. Formal letters are often sent to professionals, so your style, wording, and tone are all necessary.</p>
<h2><strong>Now, what is a formal letter?</strong></h2>
<p>Formal letters are simply letters sent to first business acquaintances to make a good impression. It’s a common practice in the business circle, especially when desiring to add a bit of decorum at first contact. All you have to do in a formal letter is to appear professional; this is the key component. Here’s an idea that would be of more help to you, imagine meeting a person for the first time, how would you present yourself at first sight. I guess you would want to appear cool, right! That thought is what you would have to apply when writing a formal letter.</p>
<h2><strong>Steps to formatting your formal letter </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Include your personal details in the top right corner of your page</strong>:</h3>
<p>Make sure to include your details in this arrangement</p>
<ul>
<li>Title and full name</li>
<li>Job description</li>
<li>House address or companies address</li>
<li>Present date</li>
<li>Email address; do avoid using unprofessional email addresses</li>
<li>Contact number</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Include recipient details in the left-hand side of your page</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Title and full name</li>
<li>Name of the company</li>
<li>The full address of the company</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://writingerrands.com/blog/letter-of-application-a-complete-guide-on-the-stages-involved/">Letter of Application: A Complete Guide on the Stages Involved</a></h2>
<h3><strong>Introduction </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dear</li>
<li>The recipient&#8217;s title</li>
<li>The recipient&#8217;s full name (if perhaps you do not know the recipient’s name, you can simply write “dear sir/madam.”)</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to format the body of your letter </strong></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is also called the opening paragraph. Use this part to simply introduce yourself. Make your message direct and concise, telling the recipient why you are contacting him or her. This section or part of the letter is simply to capture their interest.</p>
<h3>Body of the formal letter</h3>
<p>Now, this is the part you get deeper on the issue. Air out your points and impress the recipient, you can also back the relevant information at hand.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Give the utmost respect to the recipient in this section. As I said, a formal letter is all about decorum. If you may, you can add this statement at the ending, “do please contact me at your convenience.” This is generally respectful to a professional, showing that you respect his or her time.</p>
<h3> Main conclusion</h3>
<p>This is the part where you have to draw the curtains definitely for a close. And this is one of the last opportunities to make a good impression to the recipient. In this part, I’ll advise you to be in your recipient’s shoes. If you were the recipient how would you wish to be addressed?</p>
<h4>Too formal</h4>
<p>If you’re contacting someone for the first time, then this suggestion is good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use &#8220;Yours truly&#8221;</li>
<li>Use &#8220;Yours sincerely&#8221;</li>
<li>Yours faithfully (especially good, if you do not have an idea or know the recipient’s name)</li>
<li>Yours respectfully</li>
</ul>
<h4>Normal</h4>
<p>This is still good if meeting the recipient for the first time, and also if you wish to be friendly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kind regards</li>
<li>Yours humbly</li>
<li>Yours appreciatively</li>
<li>Kindest regards</li>
</ul>
<h4>Casual formal</h4>
<p>If you know the recipient well, then there is no need to have a formal tone</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you</li>
<li>Best wishes</li>
<li>Warm regards</li>
</ul>
<h3>Personal signature</h3>
<p>This makes you more professional. You can either sign by hand, print, or use a tool to make your own digital signature.</p>
<h2>Things to avoid when writing your formal letter</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid grammatical errors, remember you’re writing to a professional.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t include pointless information.</li>
<li>Try and avoid beating around the bush or being redundant.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use technical languages, especially when a recipient isn’t related to your field.</li>
<li>Stay away from contractions like, “I’m” instead apply words like; I am. Complete your phrases.</li>
</ul>
