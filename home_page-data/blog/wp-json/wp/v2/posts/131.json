Well, you\u2019ll have to know that this is a \u201cwonder drug,\u201d and they became quite popular in the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century. They were the cause of fewer deaths as experienced in the late periods of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century and early twentieth century.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are misconceptions about this wonder drug. One notable one is that you should continuously take antibiotics until you feel much better. The belief has gotten so locked up in the minds of these individuals. That even if the doctor instructs them to take the drug for a long while, they stop the dosage when they feel better. Thereby risking their health and also the doctor\u2019s trust. To get more information click this link <a href=\"http:\/\/www.verywellhealth.com\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Effects of Misuse<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s the question, did you know that by not following the doctor\u2019s instructions when he or she gives you a particular dosage in a day, you run the risk of more challenging health problems?<\/p>\n<p>It has been found by research that some particular kinds of bacteria become resistant when a patient takes an incomplete dosage. These kinds of bacteria can be termed \u201cresistant.\u201d And this can be very dangerous, thereby affecting your psychology to heal faster.<\/p>\n<p>So it is significant that everyone understands the performance of an antibiotic, especially when incorporated in the body. This is where I come in, to clear up such mistaken beliefs. Because if I cared less about this, many ignorant people can get sick even if they take more antibiotics. Such sickness of non-recuperation by the patient is what doctor\u2019s call, \u201cdrug-resistant bacteria,\u201d which attacks the body.<\/p>\n<h2>General Knowledge<\/h2>\n<p>Now before we delve in, let\u2019s have an accurate definition of what an antibiotic is, what\u2019s an antibiotic? Antibiotics are simply drugs that inhibit the growth or functionality of bacteria in the body. They do this, by inhibiting important functions within the nucleus of the bacteria.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/writingerrands.com\/blog\/drug-development-process-the-steps-and-necessities-involved\/\">Drug development process: the steps and necessities involved<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>These drugs can include ointments, tablets, and antibiotic creams. The common application of this drug is oral-introduction. These drugs are very active and stop bacterial infections. They are mostly applied or used when you have minor injuries, scrapes, and even life-threatening infections.<\/p>\n<h2>Origin<\/h2>\n<p>Early antibiotics where stored and cultivated in\u00a0 Petri dishes, in which they were grown as molds. Many infections as found by research, are caused by these molds. So in this case, molds are very helpful for production. These molecules of antibiotics were produced by these molds and used as a defense or used to attack bacteria.<\/p>\n<p>This, therefore, means we stole this defense mechanism from molds and began to use it to fight bacteria that found its way in our bodies. Presently, newer types of bacteria have been cultivated in the laboratory. And these drugs have little side-effects.<\/p>\n<h2>Side-effects<\/h2>\n<p>Some individuals are likely to have side-effects when being administered with antibiotics, and here are the symptoms;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Throat tightening<\/li>\n<li>Rash<\/li>\n<li>Swollen face<\/li>\n<li>Hives<\/li>\n<li>Gastrointestinal issues<\/li>\n<li>Headaches<\/li>\n<li>Low blood pressure and,<\/li>\n<li>Loss of consciousness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other common side-effects of this drug, include;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yeast infections<\/li>\n<li>Diarrhea<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The things you have to do and know if you\u2019re a nurse<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a nurse and this is your first time in the job, here are things you\u2019ll have to do before administering drugs to your patient;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not use antibiotics to treat viral illnesses such as viral gastroenteritis, colds, and influenza.<\/li>\n<li>Do make sure to obtain microbiology cultures before administering antibiotics to a patient. This is done to know when to stop administering the drug.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure to use antibiotics for as long as it\u2019s needed to treat infections, and also minimize the risk of relapse or control the active risk to others.<\/li>\n<li>Develop the appropriate nursing protocols for monitoring residents\u2019 status, especially for an evolving condition.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In essence, make sure when self-administering antibiotics or administering a patient with an antibiotic, you follow the required guideline from your physician or the head practitioner.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you wish to know what antibiotics are used for?
