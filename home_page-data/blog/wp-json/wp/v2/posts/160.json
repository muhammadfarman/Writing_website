However, if we could examine history, there has been outbreaks that have been so deadly, that they changed history as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>Below are 5 of the deadliest outbreaks in all of history;<\/p>\n<h2>Spanish flu (1918)<\/h2>\n<p>This influenza had happened 90 years before the major swine flu had rocked nations in the year 2009; which killed over\u00a0 200,000 people in that year. Then reports from different medical centers began to appear about the influenza, which was first located in Kansas, United states in March 1918.<\/p>\n<p>The disease had spread quickly around the world, that there was no time to curtail it. It had even spread more quickly when troops were fighting in world war 1. This outbreak when found was called the &#8220;Spanish Flu;&#8221; although the disease did not originate from there. Scientist quickly devised mechanisms to destroy the virus, but suddenly it appeared again in the year 1919 (scientist still do not know why it appeared suddenly in that year). When fully destroyed, the flu had wiped out about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rwjf.org\">50 million people and approximately 25 million of those deaths occurred in the first 25 weeks of the pandemic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>HIV\/AIDS<\/h2>\n<p>Said to originate in the Cameroon and first recognized as a disease in the year 1981. Although, the first case is recorded in 1959 at the Congo. 2011 alone, the disease has killed over 25 million people and at least 60 million people are infected. Today, it&#8217;s impact seem to vary across the world. <a href=\"https:\/\/writingerrands.com\/blog\/viral-infection-and-their-treatment\/\">Read more on viruses<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The Black death<\/h2>\n<p>It was a devastating plague in the middle of the 14th century. The Black death changed the mindset of Europe and the world. According to reports, over 75 million people had been decimated from the world population of 450 million in the year 1348. As much as half of Europe perished in this outbreak. The plagues name comes from sailors who returned from their voyage with dark-spots on their skin. It is now known to be bubonic plague because it is caused by tick bites and bites from rats.<\/p>\n<h2>The Antonine Plague<\/h2>\n<p>Named after the Roman Emperor Marcus Antonius Aurelius, who had ruled during the outbreak. The outbreak began in 165 AD and lasted till 180 AD. An estimated 5 million people died from smallpox. It is believed to have started from modern-day Iraq and had spread to Rome by soldiers returning from war. According to evaluative reports, an estimated 2000 Romans died each day. And the plague did not discriminate, even the Emperor mentioned above and his associates contracted the disease.<\/p>\n<h2>The plague of Justinian<\/h2>\n<p>It all began in the year 541, when rats from Egyptian grain boats brought the plague to the Eastern Roman Empire. That killed over 25 million people. The plague did not discriminate in status, even the Emperor, Justinian 1 had contracted the disease. It is estimated that at the end of the outbreak, 40 percent of the city, Constantinople had died from the plague. Present experts do believe that that would have been the first recorded case of the bubonic plague.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.history.com\/.amp\/topics\/middle-ages\/pandemics-timeline\">The First cholera Outbreak<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The first outbreak started in Russia, in which 1 million people died. It was spread through infected water, especially water contaminated by feces. The bacteria was further passed to British soldiers who brought the bacteria to India, in which over 3 million people were killed. The extension of the British Empire had spread it to Indonesia, China, Japan, Italy, Africa, America, Germany and Spain. Where it killed over 100,000 people. A vaccine was quickly created in 1885, but the outbreak still continued till date.<\/p>\n<h2>conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>With all these outbreaks, it is very clear that most of them suddenly spring up from the environment causing deaths as they spread. So the only way to prevent such devastating outbreaks is by having a clean environment and always make sure to disinfect your hands after you do anything.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When talking about an outbreak it may mean, a virus that kills a million people or intake of poisonous food that makes a dozen people sick.
