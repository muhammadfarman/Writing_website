However, the arrangement of your academic essay is determined by the type of essay you are writing. On your paper, since every piece has its style, it is supposed to be written in, and hence one should follow the best example of the article you are writing about in your plot.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Cover page.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The first part that should in any academic essay is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.easybib.com\/guides\/forums\/topic\/q-information-include-cover-page\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cover page.<\/a> Usually, the cover page is highly dependant on the type of essay you are writing and the instructions your instructor gives you. The most common factors found in a typical essay cover page include the;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>1.Student Name: <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">This refers to the name of the student who is undertaking the essay. In a majority of articles, the student name starts with the surname followed rest names of the student.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>2.Supervisor name:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The second part of the cover page is usually the supervisor name. The supervisor is the person in charge of your paper which a majority of the time is often your lecturer who assigned you the article in question<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>3.Topic:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">\u00a0The third part of an academic essay is usually the topic. The problem is like a one-sentence summary of what you are doing in the paper. Every word in a question should come except the conjunctions in a sentence.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>4.Date of submission:\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The submission date is usually the deadline or the time you are supposed to submit your essay to the lecturer. The date of the presentation should, in a way, the lecturer or the supervisor of your paper sees it best.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The cover page can also outline other elements; however, this highly depends on the school or the institution you are. Simply the cover page elements are not only fixed to the details talked above; they contain more parts or lesser depending on the course work you are doing for your studies. The cover page should always be centred and should not provide any other information except descriptive information like the one mentioned above in my article.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Running head.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.apastyle.org\/apastyle\/2010\/11\/running-head-format-for-apa-style-papers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/blog.apastyle.org\/apastyle\/2010\/11\/running-head-format-for-apa-style-papers.html<\/a>The running head always appears at the header part of any academic paper. It usually contains the topic as its central part. The running head is generally provided at all the pages of the academic paper that you are writing.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Introduction\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The introduction part of any essay is usually essential. The introduction part of any piece should always be around 25% of the article. The introductory part should always be a summary of the whole academic essay in question. Like any other part of an essay, the first part of the article should also contain quality reference points.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Body\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The other essential part of an essay is the body part. This part contains all the details asked in the questions in the article. A majority of the references in the body part of the essay are quality references. The body part should always try to answer all the questions that I have asked. The body can run from one page to several pages.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The body part of the essay should contain various subheadings and headings you should always ensure that you arrange your paper in logical sections that part by part explains the subject in question. The body part of your essay should contain all the citations and attempt to understand the role of all the requirements of the problem in place. To achieve higher success in your academic papers, you should always ensure that you do proper research of all the information you have in your documents and dig deeper to come out with beautiful pieces of all the papers you have in your essay. In the body part of your article, you should have all the requirements set out in the topic. The body of your essay dramatically varies with the type of essay you are writing. If your article is explanatory, the body part of your essay should be different from if your essay is in an argumentative form.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">The conclusion of your essay contains the references and the bibliography of your essay.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EXPERTS ADVICE: How should an academic essay be arranged? \u00a0There is a standard way of writing your academic papers or literature analysis before you submit it to your lecturer or supervisor.
