This is simply because the content does not fit the reader\u2019s expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Readers simply need a detailed blog post that helps to answer the questions they have. A majority of the content we have on blog posts is what is referred as \u201cfluff\u201d\/ empty content.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Adding\u00a0 Value .<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The first thing that any blog post should do is to add value. An excellent example <a href=\"http:\/\/themoneyninja.com\/app-review-freebird-pays-you-for-taking-uber-and-lyft-rides\/\">is\u00a0 the post on how you can earn money\u00a0 by riding uber<\/a> on the money ninja blog. It arises curiosity and it is relatable to the each and every day experiences of a common reader.<\/p>\n<p>A majority of the bloggers go wrong when they think on minting money from the blogs in months. They specialize more in making lots of content that does not add value.<\/p>\n<p>Great internet marketers like Neil Patel have great blog posts that answer the needs detailed on their cover pages. Click bait headings are the sole reason for a downfall in a majority of bloggers content .This is simply because readers cannot be\u00a0 fooled by a click-bait twice you can only do it once.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Research.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Not only does research content attract\u00a0 readers but it also attracts the SERPS(Search engine pages). If you write detailed content there are a variety of backlinks that shall come back to your site. Backlinks from Facebook and other social media sites\u00a0 greatly help your site rank and\u00a0 hence make your blog successful\u00a0 in reaching more readers .<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Listen to your audience.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A careful look at the best content in the in search engines will show that they have a huge audience participation. The best part about creating an audience forum is that they shall also ask questions. They also feel like part of the blog and hence they shall always be loyal. The questions asked by the audiences shall also guide you on the next topics you should write and expound on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Info graphics.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Info graphics simply refer to the non-text elements in a blog. This refer\u00a0 to pictures, statistical images and video blogs in a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>Readers relate more to content that also contain other mediums of communication. This is because they break the monotony of text. Research has shown that use of non-text elements increases the audience engagement and ratability. A good example is the <a href=\"https:\/\/themoneyninja.com\/\">money ninja blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are a variety of platforms\u00a0 bloggers can be in a position to make videos. This include video platforms like Vimeo and Youtube using special editors\u00a0 like firefox, photoshop\u00a0 and canvas , bloggers can be in a position to create rich video and graphical content that will attract and maintain audiences in the blog.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Checking out the best in your field.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Comparing notes\u00a0 especially to those people who are better than you is a great way of creating a great audience. You need to be original but also address issues raised by your competitors in a more and well researched way. This\u00a0 content strategy keeps you on track and helps\u00a0 you to easily edge out your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webopedia.com\/TERM\/W\/White_Hat_SEO.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>White Hat SEO practices.<\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\n<p>According to webmaster guidelines which are also rapidly changing, Writing flowing content helps search engines understand your site structure and the sitemaps. This will hence make your content suggested by search engines to prospective readers. One of the greatest mistakes content creators do is flooding their content with keywords so that they can be suggested by search engines, However, with the new regulations in webmaster guidelines\u00a0 stuffing your web post with keywords\u00a0 is a black hat practice that SERPS will punish and your\u00a0 readers will get bored of the content soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Blog design and presentation.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You might have a great content but the way your content is\u00a0 displayed does not attract the audience. One of the best practices according to Yoast is using a font that is over 12. Avoid crumping all your content in one forum and hence have a strategic way\u00a0 of distributing your content. In 2016, mobile indexing\u00a0 started being a serious standard in blog writing. According to Google research, over 70% of internet researches use mobile devices. Hence\u00a0 you should enhance and\u00a0 arrange your content in a manner that it is highly mobile responsive\u00a0 so that smartphone readers are also\u00a0 easily able to access your blog content<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Trends.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Needless to say, another way of adding value to your content is taping on the rapidly changing content needs of the society. Value is a quality that is created by observing the time. What is important today might be useless tomorrow. Clever bloggers always update their content regularly to always meet the rapidly changing market needs and trends. Taking time and always researching your content will always give you a cutting edge and hence make you a top blog writer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What\u2019s In It For Me?\u00a0 Needless to say, there are hundreds if not thousands of blog content out there that is not successful.
