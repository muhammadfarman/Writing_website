At this period young children are susceptible to infection such as otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, viral syndrome.

Nevertheless, seizures status epilepticus is known to be a severe form of complex seizures. Status epilepticus is a single or series of seizures without an interim recovery which lasts at least 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Viral diseases are the most common cause of febrile seizures.
