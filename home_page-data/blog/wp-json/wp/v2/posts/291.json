So, is important that you present several relevant and potential interpretations as possible. For instance, if your result does not go with your hypothesis, they are still of great value because you can then prove that going by the context of your study, your argument was not reliable, and you can then proceed to other areas for research without going the same path.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, can be an opportunity for others to research your hypothesis using different conditions. Besides, there may even be some hidden conditions that were not possible to control and isolate which you can use to back up your results<\/p>\n<p>Importantly also, you need to consider the grammatical style and tone in which you present your report. Lab reports are more often than not written in the passive voice and makes use of the third person pronoun.<\/p>\n<p>So, very recently, it is now acceptable to make use of the active voice, like \u201cLarry and Jones (1976) carried out the study and also reference yourself where relevant \u201cI hypothesized that\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Elements Of A Lab Report<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Title <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The reveals the focus of the experiment<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Abstract<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This may not be necessary for a short laboratory report<\/p>\n<p>It is usually the last part of the research findings<\/p>\n<p>It gives an overview of the research findings, and sometimes the conclusions<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Introduction<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This gives the necessary background to the experiment and tries to define relevant theories<\/p>\n<p>It states the hypothesis and \/or the problems<\/p>\n<p>Here, the objectives are stated in a concise manner<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methodology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At this point, the materials used are described, types of equipment utilized, and the procedures used clearly explained<\/p>\n<p>The flow charts of procedures should be included (where applicable), and the use of diagrams of the experimental analysis should be used also.<\/p>\n<p>In the case where data is collected, properly outline any calculations or processing done on the data<\/p>\n<p><strong>Results And Analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Explain how the results were analyzed with error analysis<\/p>\n<p>The use of tables of graphical presentation of the result is done here<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Interpretation of result in terms of the research questions\/aims<\/p>\n<p>Give a summary of the research findings and shortcomings<\/p>\n<p>Recommend ways to overcome shortcomings and give future directions<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let the audience be reminded of the problem investigated<\/p>\n<p>Summarize the findings and relate it to the problem<\/p>\n<p>Identify the cause and effect of the findings<\/p>\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This follows a specific referencing style, so, follow a particular style<\/p>\n<p>List details of the publication of all text used, this will make readers to easily and quickly find the sources<\/p>\n<p><strong>Appendices<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These are materials not included in the main document.
