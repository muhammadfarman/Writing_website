Some of these issues can be symptoms &#8220;down there&#8221;. To get the best medical care out there, you must not be shy.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, doctors have seen and heard different kinds of complaints regarding symptoms or diseases. Don&#8217;t ever feel embarrassed. If it&#8217;s that serious, just speak up about it. Always open up to your doctors. They can&#8217;t help you if you don&#8217;t reveal what you are dealing with.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> Always ask for medical records<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is a smart move. No matter the condition of your medical issue, serious or just checkups, develop a habit of asking your physician for your medical records.

Write the date down and always follow up with your doctor&#8217;s office with calls, from time to time.<\/p>\n<p>And no, you are not bothering them, it&#8217;s a priority for you, and you have absolute right to do so. Remember, he\/she is your employee.<\/p>\n<p>Lack of effective communication with your physician can cost you a lot. Always follow up for useful updates.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> Use your basic instinct if you want the best medical care<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Sure, some illnesses can be difficult for doctors to diagnose. They may tell you that you are fine and just give you certain prescriptions. A patient may find out that the treatment isn&#8217;t working. With time, your gut can give you more signs that you need more opinions for different diagnoses.<\/p>\n<p>If you have confidence in your instincts, it can save you a lot of time. And this makes it easier for your physician to guide you. Pay attention, your gut always tells you something about your health.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> Always be informed<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Even though physicians can&#8217;t know it all regarding our health, we still expect them to.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to wait till you are diagnosed with a critical illness before taking basic actions, always get informed.<\/p>\n<p>You need to always push for answers when certain symptoms occur. Only you know your body best. Your doctor won&#8217;t always have all the answers to every disease.<\/p>\n<p>Always ask important questions as to when needed and do personal research from reliable sources.
