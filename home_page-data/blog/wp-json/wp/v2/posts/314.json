It is irritating to the throat and lungs. Dry cough may be a sign of either sinus issues or a form of viral infection.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3>The wet cough<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This type of acute cough produces mucus. It varies from color to color, which may indicate a bacterial infection in the lungs.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3>The stress cough<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is a reflexive spasm of the airways which occur when one is under stress. Often, this type of stress doesn&#8217;t produce any mucus. Another thing to note about stress cough is that it is not usually from infections.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3>The barking cough<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This type of acute cough is most common with children. It could be related to viral illnesses such as croup. It is typically harsh and has the barking sound of croup. The croup cough is often caused by a swollen windpipe, the trachea.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h3>The whooping cough<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This type produces a whooping sound.\u00a0 Whooping cough may be an indication of a serious infection, it needs a thorough evaluation by a doctor. This acute cough, also known as pertussis, is a very contagious respiratory disease &#8211; it can be dangerous for infants under a year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Solution For Acute Coughs that Occur From Health Problems<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As it was stated before, the cause of the acute cough plays a major role in treating it. One way to relieve the symptoms is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for cough. Go for ones that contain guaifenesin and\/or dextromethorphan. These ingredients are often found in tablet cough syrups.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some treatments for an acute cough that are caused by either medications or diseases.<\/p>\n<p>For asthma, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled steroids are administered. These help in decreasing inflammation of the airways. They also reduce wheezing. Short-term oral steroids can also be prescribed to relieve the cough.<\/p>\n<p>For gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the treatment includes staying away from foods that increase reflux. Meals should also be avoided before lying down.\u00a0 Elevation of the head while sleeping, and taking medication such as famotidine, cimetidine, ranitidine, esomeprazole is also effective in decreasing stomach acidity.<\/p>\n<p>For sinus problems, using pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) is effective. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may improve symptoms of a runny nose. Inhaled steroids are very good when treating hay fever (this is a common cause of cough). Also, nasal inhalers like ipratropium bromide can relieve running nose. In the case of sinusitis was determined to be the cause, antibiotics may be prescribed.<\/p>\n<p>When cases are severe, a healthcare expert may prescribe narcotic medications such as codeine &#8211; they are effective cough suppressants.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Treatment for Acute Coughs from Infections or Drugs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3>For infections<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia are often treated by using antibiotics. Pain relievers such as analgesics are useful for relieving pneumonia pain. Viral infections are often responsible for many of bronchitis in most adults. The treatment here is almost the same for cold &#8211; getting adequate rest, enough fluid, humidification, and using pain reliever. In order to alleviate discomfort, one can use expectorant medicines for cough, especially those that contain guaifenesin. At times when antibiotics are prescribed, it can be difficult to tell the difference between viral bronchitis and bacterial bronchitis. Again, asthmatics can have green mucus which can be infected &#8211; the mucus can be examined by your doctor to be certain.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>For drugs and medications<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It is important for patients with an acute cough to inform their doctors if they&#8217;re also taking blood pressure medications (such as Vasotec, Prinivil, and Capoten) about switching medicines. These patients are not allowed to stop taking the blood pressure medications on their own, it is very risky. Some new generations of ACE inhibitors could be an alternative with less potential for causing an acute cough.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Know the causes of acute cough helps a patient treat it better and faster.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acute coughs or chronic cough is a type of cough that persists, beyond the normal one.
