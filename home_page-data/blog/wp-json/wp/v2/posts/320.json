Let&#8217;s talk about birth defects in children<\/p>\n<h2><strong>But what exactly are birth defects in children? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, birth defects in children are health conditions that happen before or after childbirth. \u00a0It could either be psychological, physical, or medical.<\/p>\n<p>A recent study deduced that there are over \u00a04,000 types of birth defects in children, hence making it challenging to affirm what exactly is a birth defect to other health conditions.

To put it mildly, it could result from genetic problems, environment, ingestion or even personal behaviors. Generally, a detectable birth defect is usually environmental, which might be as a result of the pregnant mother&#8217;s exposure to chemicals or problems with the genre of the baby.<\/p>\n<p>Notable medical researches have proven that the following conditions and activities can influence the chance of birth defects during pregnancy.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking certain medications<\/li>\n<li>Smoking or dealing in drugs<\/li>\n<li>Alcohol<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Certain medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As aforementioned, these are only a few activities and conditions that could lead to childbirth defects. There could be more than a thousand and one other reasons out there.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Preventing birth defects in children<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Fortunately, there are remedial steps that can be taken to curtail birth defects during pregnancy. Should it be followed strictly, there is every chance that the pregnant mother will give birth without any form of defects.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Visiting competent health care providers<\/strong>:<\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Upon discovering that you\u2019re pregnant,\u00a0 your next shot should be how to schedule your session with your health care provider. The potentials of staying healthier are more when you register for ante-natal care with competent health care practitioners. Whilst you\u2019ve gotten attended to, you should take the time to talk about every activity, medication, and complications you might be having with your doctor. This way, your gynecologist can put you through the necessities that would preferably put you on the high.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Vaccination matters: <\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One important factor that you greatly consider when having your appointment with your doctor is vaccination. You cannot underemphasize the importance one bit. Being vaccinated against flu and other sicknesses would go a long way to make sure that your pregnancy is healthy and you have a safe childbirth.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Dealing with pre-existing conditions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is important to take care of pre-existing health conditions before getting pregnant. Don\u2019t get this wrong. You do have the right to be pregnant whenever you want to so long as you have the all-round means to take care of a child. But then, you should consider the future of the child and not subject him\/her to pains or discomfort. Even you, you deserve painless childbirth. Hence, you have to take care of any conditions that can hinder you from this happiness. A good example of problems you have to deal with is diabetes and obesity. These two have a high potential of badly affecting childbirth. Take every precaution you can so you can be on a high every time.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Folic Acid is important<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Under every circumstance, a pregnant woman should ingest 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Even so, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to get prepared before the said time. With the constant taking of prenatal supplements and multivitamins, you should be able to get enough folic acid sustenance to last you for a while.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>A foreign substance is a no-no<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a pregnant woman, you don\u2019t have any business engaging in smoking, taking hard drugs or alcohol. Aside from pregnancy, these habits are injurious to health. And since you have another \u201cflexible\u201d life in you to worry about, you really should do away with it totally.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Family History and healthy living<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even without being told, healthy living is essential to living well. However, with pregnancy now in the picture, it can help deal with birth defects. Eating healthy and engaging in healthy activities would go a long way to making your baby healthy.<\/p>\n<p>Also, in the case that your family has a history of defects during childbirth, then this is the right time to discuss it with your doctor. \u00a0Your gynecologist can refer you to a genetic counselor or therapist that will help determine the potential of your child being not with a defect or not.<\/p>\n<p>However, even after prenatal testing and you know that your baby has the potential of being born with a defect, then you really shouldn\u2019t be worried or be sick over it.\u00a0 You\u2019re not alone in this quest. There are laid down programs to support pregnant women with possible childbirth defects. Simply enroll in one and get familiar with what to expect until, when and after your baby arrives.
