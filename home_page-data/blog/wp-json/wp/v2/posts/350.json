What would you do at this moment? Would you scream for help or would you just stand there numb? Perhaps you have no idea what to do. Well if you see such, anytime and any day then you\u2019ve just seen someone who is having a cardiac arrest.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the signs, especially if you suspect a loved one of yours;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unable to respond<\/strong>: The person is unable to respond even if you tap him or her so hard on the shoulders. Or if you scream his name, he\u2019s unable to hear you. There\u2019s absolutely no reaction.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Increased palpitation<\/strong>: the person is either breathing fast, gasping for air, or not breathing at all; then here is time to act.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Act Quickly as it might be a cardiac arrest<\/h2>\n<p>If you have tried all means physically, like; slapping, hitting and yelling the person\u2019s name and he or she refuses to respond. Then there is a great tendency he or she is suffering from a cardiac arrest. Here\u2019s what to do at such a moment:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If people are around you or you\u2019ve got neighbors, please scream for help immediately<\/strong>: Tell someone nearby to call the emergency care line and ask a person or another to bring an AED (automated external defibrillator), and that\u2019s if there\u2019s any presently. Everyone around you, especially YOU would need to be quick in response because time is of the essence at this moment. And if you\u2019re alone and suspect the person you\u2019re with has signs of cardiac arrest, then you\u2019ll have to call the emergency care unit at once and get an AED if you have one at the moment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/writingerrands.com\/blog\/what-you-need-to-know-about-physical-therapy\/\">What you need to know about physical therapy<\/a><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Observe rhythmic breathing<\/strong>: if the person is either gasping or not breathing at all, then administer a CPR quickly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use an AED NOW:<\/strong> use this device as soon as it arrives. Turn it on and follow the instructions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give a quick CPR<\/strong>: place your palm above each other (make sure both palms are together in the form of a fist) on his or her chest and push down at least 2 inches at a rate of 101 to 121 pushes a minute or two. Make sure is in the center of the chest and allow the chest to come back to its normal position after each soft press.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t give up, PLEASE<\/strong>: Continue with the CPR, until you see the person either move or breathe again or until a person with more advanced knowledge or training takes over from you, for example, an emergency response team member or EMS team member.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Here\u2019s why you should learn CPR<\/h2>\n<p>There is a high call for people to learn CPR, and that\u2019s because the survival rates for victims with cardiac arrest is still worryingly low.<\/p>\n<p>It is estimated that less than one in ten people survive a cardiac arrest, this is a shock to all medical personnel. You may want to ask why? Here\u2019s why, the solution to this surprisingly sudden problem, is at the same time surprisingly easy. And that\u2019s simply applying a simple CPR on the victim.<\/p>\n<p>Every minute that passes by without the application of CPR can reduce the victim\u2019s chance of ever surviving a cardiac arrest by around 10%.<\/p>\n<p>So in essence, if CPR is taught to people, it could help save hundreds, even thousands of lives annually.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe wish all young men and women feel confident and willing to help when faced with a first aid emergency, \u201csaid Joe Mulligan, head of first aid education at the British Red Cross.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning First Aid treatment of Cardiac Arrest<\/h2>\n<p>First of all, you have to know that learning first aid definitely helps to increase a person\u2019s confidence, and we believe it\u2019s a life skill and a necessity that everyone should have or apply.<\/p>\n<p>Now it comes down to you the reader, you should have the opportunity to learn first aid throughout your life, if fortunately, beginning from your school, so that generations of people can be equipped with the skill or training they need to help when there is a need for a quick response or in an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of free teaching resources on paper and online, not to forget workshops; if you wish to make it practical. Most of these workshops are designed to give young people the confidence, willingness, and the skill to act in times of emergency.<\/p>\n<p>According to Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director for NHS, England. He said, \u201cWhen one in five people witness someone fainting and who clearly needs CPR. The majority of people have no idea what to do at such a moment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This shows that teaching CPR to school children equips them with the needed knowledge, that\u2019ll help them to act in times of need. It breeds confident youngsters in the society, also allowing them to be the hero for the moment. And that can be thrilling to them.<\/p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION<\/h2>\n<p>To sum it all up, there needs to be mandatory training for all young and old people. Mostly, in the skill of administering CPR to victims of cardiac arrest. This surely would improve the rate of survival.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Someone suddenly falls on the floor, his breath is palpitating quickly, your guess the person is trying to catch his breath by all means.
