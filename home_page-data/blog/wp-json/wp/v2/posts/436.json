The pulse rate is generally low, normal, or sometimes fast but should be above 100 bets per minute. The blood pressure usually varied but should be limited to less than140\/90. The women have an immediate weight decrease of about 8 kg after conception but the further weight loss presented due to involutions of the uterus<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">2.Skin<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is increased skin pigmentation of the face, the wall of the abdomen, and vulva; however, the areolae tend to remain darker than before; there is also marked sweating<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">3 Gastrointestinal tract<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8211; Thirst<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8211; Constipation as a result of decreased tone of the bowel during pregnancy.

However, platelets count increases and became stickier from the 4th and 10th\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">day after delivery.

During the 6th week,\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">it should reduce to its usual extent of a norma multiparous uterus. The multiparous is uterus is slightly larger than the nulliparous one. The size reduction leads to contraction and retraction of the uterine muscle. The normal involuting uterus should be firm and non-tender<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">decidua tissue dies due to ischemia, and she has lochia.
